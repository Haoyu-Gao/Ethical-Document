This is the replication package for "Documenting Ethical Considerations in Open Source AI Models", under submission for ESEM'24.

## Folder Walkthrough
- `qualitative codes` contains our thematic analysis codes for documents from three data sources.
- `mine_repositories` folder contains code for mining repositories on both GitHub and Hugging Face.
- `duplicate_detection` section contains the code we used to detect document reuse.
- `Curated documents` folder contains documents we mined on three data sources. You can cross reference these raw documents with our codes under `qualitative codes` folder.

We will provide a more detailed folder explaination below.
