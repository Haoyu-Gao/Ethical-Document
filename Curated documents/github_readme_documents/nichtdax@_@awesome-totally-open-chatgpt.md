ChatGPT is GPT-3.5 finetuned with RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback) for human instruction and chat.

Alternatives are projects featuring different instruct finetuned language models for chat. 
Projects are **not** counted if they are:
- Alternative frontend projects which simply call OpenAI's APIs. 
- Using language models which are not finetuned for human instruction or chat.

Tags:
-   Bare: only source code, no data, no model's weight, no chat system
-   Standard: yes data, yes model's weight, bare chat via API
-   Full: full yes data, yes model's weight, fancy chat system including TUI and GUI
-   Complicated: semi open source, not really open source, based on closed model, etc...

## [Cohee1207/SillyTavern](https://github.com/Cohee1207/SillyTavern)

SillyTavern is a fork of TavernAI 1.2.8 which is under more active development, and has added many major features. At this point they can be thought of as completely independent programs. On its own Tavern is useless, as it's just a user interface. You have to have access to an AI system backend that can act as the roleplay character. There are various supported backends: OpenAPI API (GPT), KoboldAI (either running locally or on Google Colab), and more.
