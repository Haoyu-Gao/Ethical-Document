# CodeT5 and CodeT5+

Official research release for  **CodeT5** and **CodeT5+** models for **Code Understanding and Generation** from Salesforce Research, which are introduced by the following papers:

*Title*: [CodeT5+: Open Code Large Language Models for Code Understanding and Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.07922.pdf)

> *Authors*: [Yue Wang](https://yuewang-cuhk.github.io/)\*, [Hung Le](https://sites.google.com/view/henryle2018/home?pli=1)\*, [Akhilesh Deepak Gotmare](https://akhileshgotmare.github.io/), [Nghi D.Q.

In practice, CodeT5 and CodeT5+ models can be deployed as an AI-powered coding assistant to boost the productivity of software developers.
At Salesforce, we build an AI coding assistant demo using CodeT5 as a VS Code plugin to provide three capabilities:

- **Text-to-code generation**: generate code based on the natural language description.
- **Code autocompletion**: complete the whole function of code given the target function name.
- **Code summarization**: generate the summary of a function in natural language description.
