# BERTimbau - Portuguese BERT

This repository contains pre-trained [BERT](https://github.com/google-research/bert) models trained on the Portuguese language. BERT-Base and BERT-Large Cased variants were trained on the [BrWaC (Brazilian Web as Corpus)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326303825_The_brWaC_Corpus_A_New_Open_Resource_for_Brazilian_Portuguese), a large Portuguese corpus, for 1,000,000 steps, using whole-word mask. Model artifacts for TensorFlow and PyTorch can be found below.

The models are a result of an ongoing Master's Program. The [text submission for Qualifying Exam](qualifying_exam-portuguese_named_entity_recognition_using_bert_crf.pdf) is also included in the repository in PDF format, which contains more details about the pre-training procedure, vocabulary generation and downstream usage in the task of Named Entity Recognition.

## Download

The base and large models are available at [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/neuralmind)


## Evaluation benchmarks

The models were benchmarked on three tasks (Sentence Textual Similarity, Recognizing Textual Entailment and Named Entity Recognition) and compared to previous published results and [Multilingual BERT](https://github.com/google-research/bert/blob/master/multilingual.md). Metrics are: Pearson's correlation for STS and F1-score for RTE and NER.

| NER  | MiniHAREM (5 classes)  |    **83.7**     |     83.1       |  79.2  | 82.3 [[2]](#References) |
| NER  | MiniHAREM (10 classes) |    **78.5**     |     77.6       |  73.1  | 74.6 [[2]](#References) |

### NER experiments code

Code and instructions to reproduce the Named Entity Recognition experiments are in [`ner_evaluation/`](ner_evaluation/) directory.


## PyTorch usage example

Our PyTorch artifacts are compatible with the [ðŸ¤—Huggingface Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) library and are also available on the [Community models](https://huggingface.co/models):

- [BERTimbau Base model card](https://huggingface.co/neuralmind/bert-base-portuguese-cased)
- [BERTimbau Large model card](https://huggingface.co/neuralmind/bert-large-portuguese-cased)

```python
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer

# Using the community model
# BERT Base
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('neuralmind/bert-base-portuguese-cased')
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained('neuralmind/bert-base-portuguese-cased')

# BERT Large
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('neuralmind/bert-large-portuguese-cased')
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained('neuralmind/bert-large-portuguese-cased')

# or, using BertModel and BertTokenizer directly
from transformers import BertModel, BertTokenizer

tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('path/to/vocab.txt', do_lower_case=False)
model = BertModel.from_pretrained('path/to/bert_dir')  # Or other BERT model class
```
