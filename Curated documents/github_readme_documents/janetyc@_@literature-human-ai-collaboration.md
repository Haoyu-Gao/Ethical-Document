# Human-AI Co-Learning
### Human-AI Interaction vs Human-AI Co-Learning
![](figures/human-ai-co-learning.png)

### Three Key Concepts of Human-AI Co-Learning
- **Mutual Understanding**:
Human and AI are developing common knowledge (i.e., a shared mental model) through an iterative, interactive process.

- **Mutual Benefits**:
Human and AI as a team achieves superior results that a single human or AI cannot achieve alone.

- **Mutual Growth**:
Human and AI both have a growth mindset —i.e. they learn together, learn from each other, learn with each other, and grow and evolve over time.
