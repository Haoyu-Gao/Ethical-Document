# Data Cards Playbook

The Data Cards Playbook helps dataset producers and publishers adopt a
people-centered approach to transparency in dataset documentation.
Using the Playbook activities and resources on [our website](https://sites.research.google/datacardsplaybook), 
you can create transparency-focused metadata schema for datasets 
across domains, organizational structures, and audience groups


In this repository, you can:
- Explore templates of Transparency Artifacts (Data Cards, Model Cards, Healthsheets)
- See and contribute examples of Data Cards in this repository


## Data Cards
Data Cards are structured summaries of essential facts about various aspects of 
ML datasets needed by stakeholders across a dataset's lifecycle for responsible 
AI development. These summaries provide explanations of processes and rationales 
that shape the data and consequently the models, such as upstream sources, 
data collection and annotation methods; training and evaluation methods, intended use; 
or decisions affecting model performance.

## Hands-on Data Card creation
Our Data Card template is available in [.docx format](https://github.com/PAIR-code/datacardsplaybook/blob/main/templates/DataCardsExtendedTemplate.docx). It contains numerous sections, questions and guidelines for responses that are designed to comprehensively document any possible dataset. 

Along with Data Cards, we've also made [Healthsheets](https://github.com/PAIR-code/datacardsplaybook/blob/main/templates/Healthsheet%20Template.docx)([Research Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13028)) and [Model Card](https://github.com/PAIR-code/datacardsplaybook/blob/main/templates/Model%20Card%20%E2%80%93%20Template.docx) ([Research Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993)) templates available to document healthcare-specific datasets and general purpose models, respectively.
