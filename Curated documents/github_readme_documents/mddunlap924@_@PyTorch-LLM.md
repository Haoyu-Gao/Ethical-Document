# Introduction
This workflow helps you get accustomed to LLM project structure and PyTorch for custom model creation, showcasing a multi-class classification using a public dataset and an LLM model from Hugging Face Hub.

### Workflow Advantages
Key advantages of this workflow not commonly found elsewhere include:
- **PyTorch Models**: It employs a custom PyTorch class for LLM fine-tuning, allowing custom layers, activation functions, layer freezing, model heads, loss functions, etc. through a [PyTorch Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Module.html), unlike typical [HuggingFace Tasks](https://huggingface.co/tasks).
- **Python Modules and Directory Structure**: The organized directory structure supports [Python modules](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html) and config files for versatility, inspired by [Joel Grus' presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jiPeIFXb6U) on Jupyter Notebooks.
- **Configuration Files for Input Parameters**: For script execution via CLI or Cron scheduling, configuration files enable flexible pipeline variations and automated execution.
- **Updated PyTorch and LLM Packages**: This workflow includes recent NLP advancements and open-source software, like the post-2022 release of ChatGPT.
- **Integrated Feature Set**: The repository provides a comprehensive feature set for quick pipeline development and modification.

**NOTE**: This workflow can be adapted for many PyTorch deep learning applications, not just LLMs.


# Getting Started

To understand this workflow, proceed with the use case in the following order:

### [1.) EDA - Jupyter Notebook](./notebooks/eda.ipynb)
Review this [EDA - Jupyter Notebook](./notebooks/eda.ipynb) for a brief exploration of the CFPB data, featuring model features, target distributions, text tokens count, and data reduction.

### [2.) Model Training Walkthrough - Jupyter Notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/mddunlap924/PyTorch-LLM/blob/main/notebooks/training.ipynb)
Use this notebook to train a model via a [single configuration file](./cfgs/train-0-notebook.yaml), with supplementary pre-training tasks and further analysis techniques for model selection.

### [3.) Model Training Script - Python Script](./scripts/train_model.py)
This script offers robust long-term training routines across various [configuration files](./cfgs/train-1.yaml) and can be paired with this [bash shell script](./bash/train-all-cfgs.sh) for full automation of model development and experiments, ideal for prolonged runs and allowing your computer to work autonomously.


# Generic Workflow
THe Pseudo Code provided below guides this repository and outlines a cross-validation training process using PyTorch.

```
INPUT: YAML config. file
OUTPUT: Model checkpoints, training log

1. Load YAML config.
2. C.V. data Folds
3. Loop over each data fold:
  A.) Training module
    * Dataloader with custom preprocessing and collator
    * Train a custom PyTorch model
    * Standard PyTorch training loop with: save checkpoints, log training metrics, etc.
```

The standard PyTorch training loop, shown below, is used here. Additional modifications are implemented in the training loop to improve model performance and training/inference speed are also implemented.

```python
# loop through batches
for (inputs, labels) in data_loader:

    # extract inputs and labels
    inputs = inputs.to(device)
    labels = labels.to(device)

    # passes and weights update
    with torch.set_grad_enabled(True):
        
        # forward pass 
        preds = model(inputs)
        loss  = criterion(preds, labels)

        # backward pass
        loss.backward() 

        # weights update
        optimizer.step()
        optimizer.zero_grad()
```  

# Use Case
The NLP dataset used here is obtained from [The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/), available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/selener/consumer-complaint-database), featuring consumer complaints about financial providers.

### Model Training Objective
We're performing multi-class classification on this dataset, where the five product categories represent the *target* variable, and three *source* variables are used as input for the LLM model.
- **NOTE**: The input variables used in this example include `unstructured text` and `categorical variables`, showcasing how to combine mixed data types for LLM model fine-tuning, while selection of these variables for prediction performance wasn't the primary focus.

### Metrics
The classification performance was evaluated using MultiClass: [F1 Score](https://pytorch.org/torcheval/stable/generated/torcheval.metrics.MulticlassF1Score.html#torcheval.metrics.MulticlassF1Score), [Precision](https://pytorch.org/torcheval/stable/generated/torcheval.metrics.MulticlassPrecision.html#torcheval.metrics.MulticlassPrecision), and [Recall](https://pytorch.org/torcheval/stable/generated/torcheval.metrics.MulticlassRecall.html#torcheval.metrics.MulticlassRecall), but other metrics could be used as well.
