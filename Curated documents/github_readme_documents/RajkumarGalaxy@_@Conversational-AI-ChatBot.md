# [Conversational AI ChatBot](https://www.kaggle.com/rajkumarl/conversational-ai-chatbot)

### Intelligent ChatBot built with Microsoft's DialoGPT transformer to make conversations with human users! 

### In this project?
>##### This project builds an intelligent AI chatbot based on the famous transformer architecture - Microsoft's DialoGPT. According to [Hugging Face's model card](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/DialoGPT-medium), DialoGPT is a State-Of-The-Art large-scale pretrained dialogue response generation model for multiturn conversations. The human evaluation results indicate that the response generated from DialoGPT is comparable to human response quality under a single-turn conversation Turing test. The model is trained on 147M multi-turn dialogue from Reddit discussion thread.

### What is a chatbot?

>##### A ChatBot is a kind of virtual assistant that can build conversations with human users! A *Chat*ting Ro*bot*. Building a chatbot is one of the popular tasks in Natural Language Processing.

### Are all chatbots the same?
>##### Chatbots fall under three common categories:
>##### 1. Rule-based chatbots
>##### 2. Retrieval-based chatbots
>##### 3. Intelligent chatbots

### Rule-based chatbots
>##### These bots respond to users' inputs based on certain pre-specified rules. For instance, these rules can be defined as if-elif-else statements. While writing rules for these chatbots, it is important to expect all possible user inputs, else the bot may fail to answer properly. Hence, rule-based chatbots do not possess any cognitive skills.

### Retrieval-based chatbots
>##### These bots respond to users' inputs by retrieving the most relevant information from the given text document. The most relevant information can be determined by Natural Language Processing with a scoring system such as cosine-similarity-score. Though these bots use NLP to do conversations, they lack cognitive skills to match a real human chatting companion. The [Wiki-IR-ChatBot](https://github.com/RajkumarGalaxy/Wiki-IR-ChatBot), built by [Author](https://github.com/RajkumarGalaxy), falls under this category!


### Intelligent AI chatbots
>##### These bots respond to users' inputs after understanding the inputs, as humans do. These bots are trained with a Machine Learning Model on a large training dataset of human conversations. These bots are cognitive to match a human in conversing. Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri fall under this category. Further, most of these bots can make conversations based on the preceding chat texts (chat history). This [Conversation AI ChatBot](https://github.com/RajkumarGalaxy/Conversational-AI-ChatBot) is a kind of an intelligent chatbot!
