## Top ML Papers of the Week (January 8 - January 14) - 2024
| **Paper**  | **Links** |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 1) **InseRF** - a method for text-driven generative object insertion in the Neural 3D scenes; it enables users to provide textual descriptions and a 2D bounding box in a reference viewpoint to generate new objects in 3D scenes; InseRF is also capable of controllable and 3D-consistent object insertion without requiring explicit 3D information as input. | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05335), [Tweet](https://x.com/_akhaliq/status/1745293576794255757?s=20) |
| 2) **Sleeper Agents** - shows that LLMs can learn deceptive behavior that persists through safety training; for instance, an LLM was trained to write secure code for a specified year but given another year can enable exploitable code; this backdoor behavior can persist even when training LLMs with techniques like reinforcement learning and adversarial training. | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05566), [Tweet](https://x.com/AnthropicAI/status/1745854907968880970?s=20) |

| 7) **Improving Retrieval-Augmented LMs with Compressors** - presents two approaches to compress retrieved documents into text summaries before pre-pending them in-context: 1) extractive compressor - selects useful sentences from retrieved documents 2) abstractive compressor - generates summaries by synthesizing information from multiple documents; achieves a compression rate of as low as 6% with minimal loss in performance on language modeling tasks and open domain question answering tasks; the proposed training scheme performs selective augmentation which helps to generate empty summaries when retrieved docs are irrelevant or unhelpful for a task. | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04408), [Tweet](https://x.com/omarsar0/status/1711384213092479130?s=20)      |
| 8) **Instruct-Retro** - introduces Retro 48B, the largest LLM pretrained with retrieval; continues pretraining a 43B parameter GPT model on an additional 100B tokens by retrieving from 1.2T tokens                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07713), [Tweet](https://x.com/omarsar0/status/1712466049428521433?s=20)      |
| 9) **MemWalker** - a method to enhance long-text understanding by treating the LLM as an interactive agent that can decide how to read the text via iterative prompting; it first processes long context into a tree of summer nodes and reads in a query to traverse the tree, seeking relevant information and crafting a suitable response; this process is achieved through reasoning and enables effective reading and enhances explainability through reasoning steps.                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05029), [Tweet](https://x.com/__howardchen/status/1711584916708938042?s=20)  |
| 10) **Toward Language Agent Fine-tuning** - explores the direction of fine-tuning LLMs to obtain language agents; finds that language agents consistently improved after fine-tuning their backbone language model; claims that fine-tuning a Llama2-7B with 500 agent trajectories                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05915), [Tweet](https://x.com/omarsar0/status/1711757242905534479?s=20)      |

| 1) **LLMs Represent Space and Time** - discovers that LLMs learn linear representations of space and time across multiple scales; the representations are robust to prompt variations and unified across different entity types; demonstrate that LLMs acquire fundamental structured knowledge such as space and time, claiming that language models learn beyond superficial statistics, but literal world models.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02207), [Tweet](https://x.com/wesg52/status/1709551516577902782?s=20)         |
| 2) **Retrieval meets Long Context LLMs** - compares retrieval augmentation and long-context windows for downstream tasks to investigate if the methods can be combined to get the best of both worlds; an LLM with a 4K context window using simple RAG can achieve comparable performance to a fine-tuned LLM with 16K context; retrieval can significantly improve the performance of LLMs regardless of their extended context window sizes; a retrieval-augmented LLaMA2-70B with a 32K context window outperforms GPT-3.5-turbo-16k on seven long context tasks including question answering and query-based summarization.                                                                                          | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03025), [Tweet](https://x.com/omarsar0/status/1709749178199318545?s=20)       |
| 3) **StreamingLLM** - a framework that enables efficient streaming LLMs with attention sinks, a phenomenon where the KV states of initial tokens will largely recover the performance of window attention; the emergence of the attention sink is due to strong attention scores towards the initial tokens; this approach enables LLMs trained with finite length attention windows to generalize to infinite sequence length without any additional fine-tuning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17453), [Tweet](https://x.com/Guangxuan_Xiao/status/1708943505731801325?s=20) |

| 6) **Training LLMs with Pause Tokens** - performs training and inference on LLMs with a learnable <pause> token which helps to delay the model's answer generation and attain performance gains on general understanding tasks of Commonsense QA and math word problem-solving; experiments show that this is only beneficial provided that the delay is introduced in both pertaining and downstream fine-tuning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02226), [Tweet](https://x.com/omarsar0/status/1709573238123122959?s=20)       |
| 7) **Recursively Self-Improving Code Generation** - proposes the use of a language model-infused scaffolding program to recursively improve itself; a seed improver first improves an input program that returns the best solution which is then further tasked to improve itself; shows that the GPT-4 models can write code that can call itself to improve itself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02304), [Tweet](https://x.com/ericzelikman/status/1709721771937587541?s=20)   |
| 8) **Retrieval-Augmented Dual Instruction Tuning** - proposes a lightweight fine-tuning method to retrofit LLMs with retrieval capabilities; it involves a 2-step approach: 1) updates a pretrained LM to better use the retrieved information 2) updates the retriever to return more relevant results, as preferred by the LM Results show that fine-tuning over tasks that require both knowledge utilization and contextual awareness, each stage leads to additional gains; a 65B model achieves state-of-the-art results on a range of knowledge-intensive zero- and few-shot learning benchmarks; it outperforms existing retrieval-augmented language approaches by up to +8.9% in zero-shot and +1.4% in 5-shot. | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01352), [Tweet](https://x.com/omarsar0/status/1709204756013490494?s=20)       |
