# SynQ

SynQ is an interactive GUI built in Electron. Its main purpose is to auto-generate your Sequelize database files (as well as a bonus seed file for your convenience) and place them straight into your project directory. It was built using [ReactDragandDrop](https://github.com/react-dnd/react-dnd), allowing users to seamlessly build models and visualize the relationships of what they are building.

## Using SynQ

1. Drag a square from the sidebar to the canvas to create your first model.
2. Click on the square to add your model's title, columns, and validations.
3. Drag multiple squares to the canvas to build other models and create relationships.
4. Remember to always save your work to update the model!
5. After you are satisfied with the structure of your database, enter the path of the directory where you want SynQ to generate the files into (we recommend the path of your project).
6. Click "Create Files" and watch your files appear in the specified directory!
