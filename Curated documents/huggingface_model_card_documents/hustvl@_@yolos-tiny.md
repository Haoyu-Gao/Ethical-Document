# YOLOS (tiny-sized) model

YOLOS model fine-tuned on COCO 2017 object detection (118k annotated images). It was introduced in the paper [You Only Look at One Sequence: Rethinking Transformer in Vision through Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00666) by Fang et al. and first released in [this repository](https://github.com/hustvl/YOLOS). 

Disclaimer: The team releasing YOLOS did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by the Hugging Face team.

## Model description

YOLOS is a Vision Transformer (ViT) trained using the DETR loss. Despite its simplicity, a base-sized YOLOS model is able to achieve 42 AP on COCO validation 2017 (similar to DETR and more complex frameworks such as Faster R-CNN).

The model is trained using a "bipartite matching loss": one compares the predicted classes + bounding boxes of each of the N = 100 object queries to the ground truth annotations, padded up to the same length N (so if an image only contains 4 objects, 96 annotations will just have a "no object" as class and "no bounding box" as bounding box). The Hungarian matching algorithm is used to create an optimal one-to-one mapping between each of the N queries and each of the N annotations. Next, standard cross-entropy (for the classes) and a linear combination of the L1 and generalized IoU loss (for the bounding boxes) are used to optimize the parameters of the model.

## Intended uses & limitations

You can use the raw model for object detection. See the [model hub](https://huggingface.co/models?search=hustvl/yolos) to look for all available YOLOS models.

### How to use

Here is how to use this model:

```python
from transformers import YolosImageProcessor, YolosForObjectDetection
from PIL import Image
import torch
import requests

url = "http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg"
image = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)

model = YolosForObjectDetection.from_pretrained('hustvl/yolos-tiny')
image_processor = YolosImageProcessor.from_pretrained("hustvl/yolos-tiny")

inputs = image_processor(images=image, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model(**inputs)

# model predicts bounding boxes and corresponding COCO classes
logits = outputs.logits
bboxes = outputs.pred_boxes


# print results
target_sizes = torch.tensor([image.size[::-1]])
results = image_processor.post_process_object_detection(outputs, threshold=0.9, target_sizes=target_sizes)[0]
for score, label, box in zip(results["scores"], results["labels"], results["boxes"]):
    box = [round(i, 2) for i in box.tolist()]
    print(
        f"Detected {model.config.id2label[label.item()]} with confidence "
        f"{round(score.item(), 3)} at location {box}"
    )
```

Currently, both the feature extractor and model support PyTorch. 

## Training data

The YOLOS model was pre-trained on [ImageNet-1k](https://huggingface.co/datasets/imagenet2012) and fine-tuned on [COCO 2017 object detection](https://cocodataset.org/#download), a dataset consisting of 118k/5k annotated images for training/validation respectively. 

### Training

The model was pre-trained for 300 epochs on ImageNet-1k and fine-tuned for 300 epochs on COCO.

## Evaluation results

This model achieves an AP (average precision) of **28.7** on COCO 2017 validation. For more details regarding evaluation results, we refer to the original paper.
