extra_gated_prompt: The collected information will help acquire a better knowledge
  of pyannote.audio userbase and help its maintainers apply for grants to improve
  it further. If you are an academic researcher, please cite the relevant papers in
  your own publications using the model. If you work for a company, please consider
  contributing back to pyannote.audio development (e.g. through unrestricted gifts).
  We also provide scientific consulting services around speaker diarization and machine
  listening.

# ðŸŽ¹ Overlapped speech detection

Relies on pyannote.audio 2.1: see [installation instructions](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio#installation).

```python
# 1. visit hf.co/pyannote/segmentation and accept user conditions
# 2. visit hf.co/settings/tokens to create an access token
# 3. instantiate pretrained overlapped speech detection pipeline
from pyannote.audio import Pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline.from_pretrained("pyannote/overlapped-speech-detection",
                                    use_auth_token="ACCESS_TOKEN_GOES_HERE")
output = pipeline("audio.wav")

for speech in output.get_timeline().support():
    # two or more speakers are active between speech.start and speech.end
    ...
```
