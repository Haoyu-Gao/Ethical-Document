# âœ¨ bert-restore-punctuation
[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/gluten-free.svg)]()

This a bert-base-uncased model finetuned for punctuation restoration on [Yelp Reviews](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/yelp_polarity_reviews). 

The model predicts the punctuation and upper-casing of plain, lower-cased text. An example use case can be ASR output. Or other cases when text has lost punctuation.

This model is intended for direct use as a punctuation restoration model for the general English language. Alternatively, you can use this for further fine-tuning on domain-specific texts for punctuation restoration tasks.

Model restores the following punctuations -- **[! ? . , - : ; ' ]**

The model also restores the upper-casing of words.

## ðŸš‹ Usage
**Below is a quick way to get up and running with the model.**
1. First, install the package.
```bash
pip install rpunct
```
2. Sample python code.
```python
from rpunct import RestorePuncts
# The default language is 'english'
rpunct = RestorePuncts()
rpunct.punctuate("""in 2018 cornell researchers built a high-powered detector that in combination with an algorithm-driven process called ptychography set a world record
by tripling the resolution of a state-of-the-art electron microscope as successful as it was that approach had a weakness it only worked with ultrathin samples that were

**This model works on arbitrarily large text in English language and uses GPU if available.**

## ðŸ“¡ Training data

Here is the number of product reviews we used for finetuning the model:

| Language | Number of text samples|
| -------- | ----------------- |
| English  | 560,000           |

We found the best convergence around _**3 epochs**_, which is what presented here and available via a download.

## ðŸŽ¯ Accuracy
The fine-tuned model obtained the following accuracy on 45,990 held-out text samples:

| Accuracy | Overall F1 | Eval Support |
| -------- | ---------------------- | ------------------- |
| 91%  | 90%                 | 45,990

Below is a breakdown of the performance of the model by each label:
