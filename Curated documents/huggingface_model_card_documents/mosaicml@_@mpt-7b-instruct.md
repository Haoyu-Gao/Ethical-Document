# MPT-7B-Instruct

MPT-7B-Instruct is a model for short-form instruction following.
It is built by finetuning [MPT-7B](https://huggingface.co/mosaicml/mpt-7b) on a [dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/sam-mosaic/dolly_hhrlhf) derived from the [Databricks Dolly-15k](https://huggingface.co/datasets/databricks/databricks-dolly-15k) and the [Anthropic Helpful and Harmless (HH-RLHF)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Anthropic/hh-rlhf) datasets.

This model was trained by [MosaicML](https://www.mosaicml.com) and follows a modified decoder-only transformer architecture.

### Example Question/Instruction

**Longboi24**:
> What is a quoll?

**MPT-7B-Instruct**:

>A Quoll (pronounced “cool”) is one of Australia’s native carnivorous marsupial mammals, which are also known as macropods or wallabies in other parts around Asia and South America

## How to Use

Note: This model requires that `trust_remote_code=True` be passed to the `from_pretrained` method. This is because we use a custom model architecture that is not yet part of the `transformers` package.

It includes options for many training efficiency features such as [FlashAttention (Dao et al. 2022)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14135.pdf), [ALiBi](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12409), QK LayerNorm, and more.

```python
import transformers
model = transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
  'mosaicml/mpt-7b-instruct',
  trust_remote_code=True
)
```
Note: This model requires that `trust_remote_code=True` be passed to the `from_pretrained` method.
This is because we use a custom `MPT` model architecture that is not yet part of the Hugging Face `transformers` package.
`MPT` includes options for many training efficiency features such as [FlashAttention](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14135.pdf), [ALiBi](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12409), [QK LayerNorm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04245), and more.

To use the optimized [triton implementation](https://github.com/openai/triton) of FlashAttention, you can load the model on GPU (`cuda:0`) with `attn_impl='triton'` and with `bfloat16` precision:
```python
import torch
import transformers

name = 'mosaicml/mpt-7b-instruct'

config = transformers.AutoConfig.from_pretrained(name, trust_remote_code=True)
config.attn_config['attn_impl'] = 'triton'
config.init_device = 'cuda:0' # For fast initialization directly on GPU!

model = transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
  name,
  config=config,
  torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, # Load model weights in bfloat16
  trust_remote_code=True
)
```

Although the model was trained with a sequence length of 2048, ALiBi enables users to increase the maximum sequence length during finetuning and/or inference. For example:

```python
import transformers

name = 'mosaicml/mpt-7b-instruct'

config = transformers.AutoConfig.from_pretrained(name, trust_remote_code=True)
config.max_seq_len = 4096 # (input + output) tokens can now be up to 4096

model = transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
  name,
  config=config,
  trust_remote_code=True
)
```

This model was trained with the [EleutherAI/gpt-neox-20b](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-neox-20b) tokenizer.

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("EleutherAI/gpt-neox-20b")
```

The model can then be used, for example, within a text-generation pipeline.  
Note: when running Torch modules in lower precision, it is best practice to use the [torch.autocast context manager](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/amp.html).

```python
from transformers import pipeline

pipe = pipeline('text-generation', model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer, device='cuda:0')

with torch.autocast('cuda', dtype=torch.bfloat16):
    print(
        pipe('Here is a recipe for vegan banana bread:\n',
            max_new_tokens=100,
            do_sample=True,
            use_cache=True))
```

### Formatting

This model was trained on data formatted in the dolly-15k format:

```python
INSTRUCTION_KEY = "### Instruction:"
RESPONSE_KEY = "### Response:"
INTRO_BLURB = "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request."
PROMPT_FOR_GENERATION_FORMAT = """{intro}
{instruction_key}
{instruction}
{response_key}
""".format(
    intro=INTRO_BLURB,
    instruction_key=INSTRUCTION_KEY,
    instruction="{instruction}",
    response_key=RESPONSE_KEY,
)

example = "James decides to run 3 sprints 3 times a week. He runs 60 meters each sprint. How many total meters does he run a week? Explain before answering."
fmt_ex = PROMPT_FOR_GENERATION_FORMAT.format(instruction=example)
```

In the above example, `fmt_ex` is ready to be tokenized and sent through the model.

## Model Description

The architecture is a modification of a standard decoder-only transformer.

The model has been modified from a standard transformer in the following ways:
* It uses [FlashAttention](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14135.pdf)
* It uses [ALiBi (Attention with Linear Biases)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12409) and does not use positional embeddings
* It does not use biases

## PreTraining Data

For more details on the pretraining process, see [MPT-7B](https://huggingface.co/mosaicml/mpt-7b).

The data was tokenized using the [EleutherAI/gpt-neox-20b](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-neox-20b) tokenizer.

### Training Configuration

This model was trained on 8 A100-40GBs for about 2.3 hours using the [MosaicML Platform](https://www.mosaicml.com/platform).
The model was trained with sharded data parallelism using [FSDP](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/fsdp.html) and used the AdamW optimizer.

## Limitations and Biases

_The following language is modified from [EleutherAI's GPT-NeoX-20B](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-neox-20b)_

MPT-7B-Instruct can produce factually incorrect output, and should not be relied on to produce factually accurate information.
MPT-7B-Instruct was trained on various public datasets.
While great efforts have been taken to clean the pretraining data, it is possible that this model could generate lewd, biased or otherwise offensive outputs.
