# Vision Transformer (base-sized model) pre-trained with MAE

Vision Transformer (ViT) model pre-trained using the MAE method. It was introduced in the paper [Masked Autoencoders Are Scalable Vision Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06377) by Kaiming He, Xinlei Chen, Saining Xie, Yanghao Li, Piotr Doll√°r, Ross Girshick and first released in [this repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/mae). 

Disclaimer: The team releasing MAE did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by the Hugging Face team.

## Model description

The Vision Transformer (ViT) is a transformer encoder model (BERT-like). Images are presented to the model as a sequence of fixed-size patches.

During pre-training, one randomly masks out a high portion (75%) of the image patches. First, the encoder is used to encode the visual patches. Next, a learnable (shared) mask token is added at the positions of the masked patches. The decoder takes the encoded visual patches and mask tokens as input and reconstructs raw pixel values for the masked positions.

By pre-training the model, it learns an inner representation of images that can then be used to extract features useful for downstream tasks: if you have a dataset of labeled images for instance, you can train a standard classifier by placing a linear layer on top of the pre-trained encoder.

## Intended uses & limitations

You can use the raw model for image classification. See the [model hub](https://huggingface.co/models?search=facebook/vit-mae) to look for
fine-tuned versions on a task that interests you.

### How to use

Here is how to use this model:

```python
from transformers import AutoImageProcessor, ViTMAEForPreTraining
from PIL import Image
import requests

url = 'http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg'
image = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)

processor = AutoImageProcessor.from_pretrained('facebook/vit-mae-base')
model = ViTMAEForPreTraining.from_pretrained('facebook/vit-mae-base')

inputs = processor(images=image, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model(**inputs)
loss = outputs.loss
mask = outputs.mask
ids_restore = outputs.ids_restore
```
