# Dreamlike Anime 1.0 is a high quality anime model, made by [dreamlike.art](https://dreamlike.art/).

# If you want to use dreamlike models on your website/app/etc., check the license at the bottom first!  

Add **anime** to your prompt to make your gens look more anime.  
Add **photo** to your prompt to make your gens look more photorealistic and have better anatomy.  
This model was trained on 768x768px images, so use 768x768px, 704x832px, 832x704px, etc. Higher resolution or non-square aspect ratios may produce artifacts.  

Add this to the start of your prompts for best results:
```
photo anime, masterpiece, high quality, absurdres
```

Use negative prompts for best results, for example:
```
simple background, duplicate, retro style, low quality, lowest quality, 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013, bad anatomy,
bad proportions, extra digits, lowres, username, artist name, error, duplicate, watermark, signature, text, extra digit, fewer digits, worst quality,
jpeg artifacts, blurry
```

**1girl**, **girl**, etc. give a bit different results, feel free to experiment and see which one you like more!

### ðŸ§¨ Diffusers

This model can be used just like any other Stable Diffusion model. For more information,
please have a look at the [Stable Diffusion Pipeline](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion).

```python
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
import torch

model_id = "dreamlike-art/dreamlike-anime-1.0"
pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

prompt = "anime, masterpiece, high quality, 1girl, solo, long hair, looking at viewer, blush, smile, bangs, blue eyes, skirt, medium breasts, iridescent, gradient, colorful, besides a cottage, in the country"
negative_prompt = 'simple background, duplicate, retro style, low quality, lowest quality, 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013, bad anatomy, bad proportions, extra digits, lowres, username, artist name, error, duplicate, watermark, signature, text, extra digit, fewer digits, worst quality, jpeg artifacts, blurry'
image = pipe(prompt, negative_prompt=negative_prompt).images[0]

image.save("./result.jpg")
```
