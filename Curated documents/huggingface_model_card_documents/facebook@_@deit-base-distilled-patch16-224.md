# Distilled Data-efficient Image Transformer (base-sized model)

Distilled data-efficient Image Transformer (DeiT) model pre-trained and fine-tuned on ImageNet-1k (1 million images, 1,000 classes) at resolution 224x224. It was first introduced in the paper [Training data-efficient image transformers & distillation through attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12877) by Touvron et al. and first released in [this repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/deit). However, the weights were converted from the [timm repository](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models) by Ross Wightman.  

Disclaimer: The team releasing DeiT did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by the Hugging Face team.

## Model description

This model is a distilled Vision Transformer (ViT). It uses a distillation token, besides the class token, to effectively learn from a teacher (CNN) during both pre-training and fine-tuning. The distillation token is learned through backpropagation, by interacting with the class ([CLS]) and patch tokens through the self-attention layers.

Images are presented to the model as a sequence of fixed-size patches (resolution 16x16), which are linearly embedded. 

## Intended uses & limitations

You can use the raw model for image classification. See the [model hub](https://huggingface.co/models?search=facebook/deit) to look for
fine-tuned versions on a task that interests you.

### How to use

Since this model is a distilled ViT model, you can plug it into DeiTModel, DeiTForImageClassification or DeiTForImageClassificationWithTeacher. Note that the model expects the data to be prepared using DeiTFeatureExtractor. Here we use AutoFeatureExtractor, which will automatically use the appropriate feature extractor given the model name. 

Here is how to use this model to classify an image of the COCO 2017 dataset into one of the 1,000 ImageNet classes:

```python
from transformers import AutoFeatureExtractor, DeiTForImageClassificationWithTeacher
from PIL import Image
import requests

url = 'http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg'
image = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)

feature_extractor = AutoFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained('facebook/deit-base-distilled-patch16-224')
model = DeiTForImageClassificationWithTeacher.from_pretrained('facebook/deit-base-distilled-patch16-224')

inputs = feature_extractor(images=image, return_tensors="pt")

# forward pass
outputs = model(**inputs)
logits = outputs.logits

# model predicts one of the 1000 ImageNet classes
predicted_class_idx = logits.argmax(-1).item()
print("Predicted class:", model.config.id2label[predicted_class_idx])
```

Currently, both the feature extractor and model support PyTorch. Tensorflow and JAX/FLAX are coming soon.

## Training data

This model was pretrained and fine-tuned with distillation on [ImageNet-1k](http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/), a dataset consisting of 1 million images and 1k classes. 

## Training procedure

### Preprocessing

The exact details of preprocessing of images during training/validation can be found [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/deit/blob/ab5715372db8c6cad5740714b2216d55aeae052e/datasets.py#L78). 

At inference time, images are resized/rescaled to the same resolution (256x256), center-cropped at 224x224 and normalized across the RGB channels with the ImageNet mean and standard deviation.

### Pretraining

The model was trained on a single 8-GPU node for 3 days. Training resolution is 224. For all hyperparameters (such as batch size and learning rate) we refer to table 9 of the original paper.

Note that for fine-tuning, the best results are obtained with a higher resolution (384x384). Of course, increasing the model size will result in better performance.
