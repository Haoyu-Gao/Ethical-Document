# Swin2SR model (image super-resolution)

Swin2SR model that upscales images x4. It was introduced in the paper [Swin2SR: SwinV2 Transformer for Compressed Image Super-Resolution and Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11345)
by Conde et al. and first released in [this repository](https://github.com/mv-lab/swin2sr). 

# Intended use cases

This model is intended for real-world image super resolution.

# Usage
