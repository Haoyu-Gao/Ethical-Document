# ‚ìçTTS
‚ìçTTS is a Voice generation model that lets you clone voices into different languages by using just a quick 6-second audio clip. There is no need for an excessive amount of training data that spans countless hours.

This is the same or similar model to what powers [Coqui Studio](https://coqui.ai/) and [Coqui API](https://docs.coqui.ai/docs).

### Features
- Supports 17 languages. 
- Voice cloning with just a 6-second audio clip.
- Emotion and style transfer by cloning. 
- Cross-language voice cloning.
- Multi-lingual speech generation.
- 24khz sampling rate.

### Updates over XTTS-v1
- 2 new languages; Hungarian and Korean
- Architectural improvements for speaker conditioning.
- Enables the use of multiple speaker references and interpolation between speakers.
- Stability improvements.
- Better prosody and audio quality across the board.

### Languages
XTTS-v2 supports 17 languages: **English (en), Spanish (es), French (fr), German (de), Italian (it), Portuguese (pt),
Polish (pl), Turkish (tr), Russian (ru), Dutch (nl), Czech (cs), Arabic (ar), Chinese (zh-cn), Japanese (ja), Hungarian (hu), Korean (ko)
Hindi (hi)**.

Stay tuned as we continue to add support for more languages. If you have any language requests, feel free to reach out!

### Code
The [code-base](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS) supports inference and [fine-tuning](https://tts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/models/xtts.html#training).

Using üê∏TTS API:

```python
from TTS.api import TTS
tts = TTS("tts_models/multilingual/multi-dataset/xtts_v2", gpu=True)

# generate speech by cloning a voice using default settings
tts.tts_to_file(text="It took me quite a long time to develop a voice, and now that I have it I'm not going to be silent.",
                file_path="output.wav",
                speaker_wav="/path/to/target/speaker.wav",
                language="en")

```

Using üê∏TTS Command line:

```console
 tts --model_name tts_models/multilingual/multi-dataset/xtts_v2 \
     --text "Bug√ºn okula gitmek istemiyorum." \
     --speaker_wav /path/to/target/speaker.wav \
     --language_idx tr \
     --use_cuda true
```

Using the model directly:

```python
from TTS.tts.configs.xtts_config import XttsConfig
from TTS.tts.models.xtts import Xtts

config = XttsConfig()
config.load_json("/path/to/xtts/config.json")
model = Xtts.init_from_config(config)
model.load_checkpoint(config, checkpoint_dir="/path/to/xtts/", eval=True)
model.cuda()

outputs = model.synthesize(
    "It took me quite a long time to develop a voice and now that I have it I am not going to be silent.",
    config,
    speaker_wav="/data/TTS-public/_refclips/3.wav",
    gpt_cond_len=3,
    language="en",
)
```
