# grammar-synthesis-small (beta)

This model is a fine-tuned version of [google/t5-small-lm-adapt](https://huggingface.co/google/t5-small-lm-adapt) for grammar correction on an expanded version of the [JFLEG](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/jfleg) dataset.

usage in Python (after `pip install transformers`):

```python
from transformers import pipeline
corrector = pipeline(
              'text2text-generation',
              'pszemraj/grammar-synthesis-small',
              )
raw_text = 'i can has cheezburger'
results = corrector(raw_text)
print(results)
```

Check out a simple demo in [Google Colab here](https://colab.research.google.com/gist/pszemraj/06fac5b608889e258229a659cc53485f/demo-for-grammar-synthesis-small.ipynb).

## Model description

The intent is to create a text2text language model that successfully completes "single-shot grammar correction" on a potentially grammatically incorrect text **that could have a lot of mistakes** with the important qualifier of **it does not semantically change text/information that IS grammatically correct.**

Compare some of the heavier-error examples on [other grammar correction models](https://huggingface.co/models?dataset=dataset:jfleg) to see the difference :)

## Limitations

- dataset: `cc-by-nc-sa-4.0`
- model: `apache-2.0`
- this is **still a work-in-progress** and while probably useful for "single-shot grammar correction" in a lot of cases, **give the outputs a glance for correctness ok?**

## Use Cases

Obviously, this section is quite general as there are many things one can use "general single-shot grammar correction" for. Some ideas or use cases:

1. Correcting highly error-prone LM outputs. Some examples would be audio transcription (ASR) (this is literally some of the examples) or something like handwriting OCR. 
    - To be investigated further, depending on what model/system is used it _might_ be worth it to apply this after OCR on typed characters. 
2. Correcting/infilling text generated by text generation models to be cohesive/remove obvious errors that break the conversation immersion. I use this on the outputs of [this OPT 2.7B chatbot-esque model of myself](https://huggingface.co/pszemraj/opt-peter-2.7B).

  _Note: that I have some other logic that removes any periods at the end of the final sentence in this chatbot setting [to avoid coming off as passive aggressive](https://www.npr.org/2020/09/05/909969004/before-texting-your-kid-make-sure-to-double-check-your-punctuation)_
  
3. Somewhat related to #2 above, fixing/correcting so-called [tortured-phrases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06751) that are dead giveaways text was generated by a language model. _Note that _SOME_ of these are not fixed, especially as they venture into domain-specific terminology (i.e. irregular timberland instead of Random Forest)._
