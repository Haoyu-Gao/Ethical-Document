# Falcon-7B-Instruct GPTQ

This repo contains an experimantal GPTQ 4bit model for [Falcon-7B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct).

It is the result of quantising to 4bit using [AutoGPTQ](https://github.com/PanQiWei/AutoGPTQ).

## PERFORMANCE

Please note that performance with this GPTQ is currently very slow with AutoGPTQ.

It may perform better with the latest GPTQ-for-LLaMa code, but I havne't tested that personally yet.

## Prompt template

```
A helpful assistant who helps the user with any questions asked.
User: prompt
Assistant:
```

## AutoGPTQ

AutoGPTQ is required: `GITHUB_ACTIONS=true pip install auto-gptq`

AutoGPTQ provides pre-compiled wheels for Windows and Linux, with CUDA toolkit 11.7 or 11.8.

If you are running CUDA toolkit 12.x, you will need to compile your own by following these instructions:

```
git clone https://github.com/PanQiWei/AutoGPTQ
cd AutoGPTQ
pip install .
```

These manual steps will require that you have the [Nvidia CUDA toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-12-0-1-download-archive) installed.

## How to download and use this model in text-generation-webui

1. Launch text-generation-webui
2. Click the **Model tab**.
3. Untick **Autoload model**
4. Under **Download custom model or LoRA**, enter `TheBloke/falcon-7B-instruct-GPTQ`.
5. Click **Download**.
6. Wait until it says it's finished downloading.
7. Click the **Refresh** icon next to **Model** in the top left.
8. In the **Model drop-down**: choose the model you just downloaded, `falcon-7B-instruct-GPTQ`.
9. Set **Loader** to **AutoGPTQ**. This model will not work with ExLlama. It might work with recent GPTQ-for-LLaMa but I haven't tested that.
10. Tick **Trust Remote Code**, followed by **Save Settings**
11. Click **Reload**.
12. Once it says it's loaded, click the **Text Generation tab** and enter a prompt!

## About `trust_remote_code`

Please be aware that this command line argument causes Python code provided by Falcon to be executed on your machine.

This code is required at the moment because Falcon is too new to be supported by Hugging Face transformers. At some point in the future transformers will support the model natively, and then `trust_remote_code` will no longer be needed.

In this repo you can see two `.py` files - these are the files that get executed. They are copied from the base repo at [Falcon-7B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct).

## Simple Python example code

To run this code you need to install AutoGPTQ and einops:
```
GITHUB_ACTIONS=true pip install auto-gptq
pip install einops
```

You can then run this example code:
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, pipeline, logging
from auto_gptq import AutoGPTQForCausalLM, BaseQuantizeConfig
import argparse

model_name_or_path = "TheBloke/falcon-7b-instruct-GPTQ"
# You could also download the model locally, and access it there
# model_name_or_path = "/path/to/TheBloke_falcon-7b-instruct-GPTQ"

model_basename = "model"

use_triton = False

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name_or_path, use_fast=True)

model = AutoGPTQForCausalLM.from_quantized(model_name_or_path,
        model_basename=model_basename,
        use_safetensors=True,
        trust_remote_code=True,
        device="cuda:0",
        use_triton=use_triton,
        quantize_config=None)

prompt = "Tell me about AI"
prompt_template=f'''A helpful assistant who helps the user with any questions asked.
User: {prompt}
Assistant:'''

print("\n\n*** Generate:")

input_ids = tokenizer(prompt_template, return_tensors='pt').input_ids.cuda()
output = model.generate(inputs=input_ids, temperature=0.7, max_new_tokens=512)
print(tokenizer.decode(output[0]))

# Inference can also be done using transformers' pipeline
# Note that if you use pipeline, you will see a spurious error message saying the model type is not supported
# This can be ignored!  Or you can hide it with the following logging line:
# Prevent printing spurious transformers error when using pipeline with AutoGPTQ
logging.set_verbosity(logging.CRITICAL)

print("*** Pipeline:")
pipe = pipeline(
    "text-generation",
    model=model,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    max_new_tokens=512,
    temperature=0.7,
    top_p=0.95,
    repetition_penalty=1.15
)

print(pipe(prompt_template)[0]['generated_text'])
```

## Provided files

**gptq_model-4bit-64g.safetensors**

This will work with AutoGPTQ 0.2.0 and later.

It was created with groupsize 64 to give higher inference quality, and without `desc_act` (act-order) to increase inference speed.

* `gptq_model-4bit-64g.safetensors`
  * Works with AutoGPTQ CUDA 0.2.0 and later.
    * At this time it does not work with AutoGPTQ Triton, but support will hopefully be added in time.
  * Works with text-generation-webui using `--trust-remote-code`
  * Does not work with any version of GPTQ-for-LLaMa
  * Parameters: Groupsize = 64. No act-order.

# âœ¨ Original model card: Falcon-7B-Instruct

**Falcon-7B-Instruct is a 7B parameters causal decoder-only model built by [TII](https://www.tii.ae) based on [Falcon-7B](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-7b) and finetuned on a mixture of chat/instruct datasets. It is made available under the [TII Falcon LLM License](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct/blob/main/LICENSE.txt).**

*Paper coming soon ðŸ˜Š.*

## Why use Falcon-7B-Instruct?

* **You are looking for a ready-to-use chat/instruct model based on [Falcon-7B](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-7b).**
* **Falcon-7B is a strong base model, outperforming comparable open-source models** (e.g., [MPT-7B](https://huggingface.co/mosaicml/mpt-7b), [StableLM](https://github.com/Stability-AI/StableLM), [RedPajama](https://huggingface.co/togethercomputer/RedPajama-INCITE-Base-7B-v0.1) etc.), thanks to being trained on 1,500B tokens of [RefinedWeb](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tiiuae/falcon-refinedweb) enhanced with curated corpora. See the [OpenLLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard).
* **It features an architecture optimized for inference**, with FlashAttention ([Dao et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135)) and multiquery ([Shazeer et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02150)).

ðŸ’¬ **This is an instruct model, which may not be ideal for further finetuning.** If you are interested in building your own instruct/chat model, we recommend starting from [Falcon-7B](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-7b).

ðŸ”¥ **Looking for an even more powerful model?** [Falcon-40B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-40b-instruct) is Falcon-7B-Instruct's big brother!

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM
import transformers
import torch

model = "tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct"

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model)
pipeline = transformers.pipeline(
    "text-generation",
    model=model,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    trust_remote_code=True,
    device_map="auto",
)
sequences = pipeline(
   "Girafatron is obsessed with giraffes, the most glorious animal on the face of this Earth. Giraftron believes all other animals are irrelevant when compared to the glorious majesty of the giraffe.\nDaniel: Hello, Girafatron!\nGirafatron:",
    max_length=200,
    do_sample=True,
    top_k=10,
    num_return_sequences=1,
    eos_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id,
)
for seq in sequences:
    print(f"Result: {seq['generated_text']}")

```

ðŸ’¥ **Falcon LLMs require PyTorch 2.0 for use with `transformers`!**


# Model Card for Falcon-7B-Instruct

## Model Details

### Model Description

- **Developed by:** [https://www.tii.ae](https://www.tii.ae);
- **Model type:** Causal decoder-only;
- **Language(s) (NLP):** English and French;
- **License:** [TII Falcon LLM License](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct/blob/main/LICENSE.txt);
- **Finetuned from model:** [Falcon-7B](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-7b).

## Uses

### Direct Use

Falcon-7B-Instruct has been finetuned on a mixture of instruct and chat datasets.

### Out-of-Scope Use

Production use without adequate assessment of risks and mitigation; any use cases which may be considered irresponsible or harmful.

## Bias, Risks, and Limitations

Falcon-7B-Instruct is mostly trained on English data, and will not generalize appropriately to other languages. Furthermore, as it is trained on a large-scale corpora representative of the web, it will carry the stereotypes and biases commonly encountered online.

### Recommendations

We recommend users of Falcon-7B-Instruct to develop guardrails and to take appropriate precautions for any production use.

The data was tokenized with the Falcon-[7B](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-7b)/[40B](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-40b) tokenizer.


## Evaluation

*Paper coming soon.*

See the [OpenLLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard) for early results.

Note that this model variant is not optimized for NLP benchmarks.


## Technical Specifications

For more information about pretraining, see [Falcon-7B](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-7b).

### Model Architecture and Objective

Falcon-7B is a causal decoder-only model trained on a causal language modeling task (i.e., predict the next token).

The architecture is broadly adapted from the GPT-3 paper ([Brown et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165)), with the following differences:

* **Positionnal embeddings:** rotary ([Su et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09864));
* **Attention:** multiquery ([Shazeer et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02150)) and FlashAttention ([Dao et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135));
* **Decoder-block:** parallel attention/MLP with a single layer norm.

| **Hyperparameter** | **Value** | **Comment**                            |
|--------------------|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| Layers             | 32        |                                        |
| `d_model`          | 4544      | Increased to compensate for multiquery                                       |
| `head_dim`         | 64        | Reduced to optimise for FlashAttention |
| Vocabulary         | 65024     |                                        |
| Sequence length    | 2048      |                                        |
