- text: 'CASE: A 28-year-old previously healthy man presented with a 6-week history
    of palpitations. The symptoms occurred during rest, 2â€“3 times per week, lasted
    up to 30 minutes at a time and were associated with dyspnea. Except for a grade
    2/6 holosystolic tricuspid regurgitation murmur (best heard at the left sternal
    border with inspiratory accentuation), physical examination yielded unremarkable
    findings.'
  example_title: example 1
- text: A 63-year-old woman with no known cardiac history presented with a sudden
    onset of dyspnea requiring intubation and ventilatory support out of hospital.
    She denied preceding symptoms of chest discomfort, palpitations, syncope or infection.
    The patient was afebrile and normotensive, with a sinus tachycardia of 140 beats/min.
  example_title: example 2
- text: A 48 year-old female presented with vaginal bleeding and abnormal Pap smears.
    Upon diagnosis of invasive non-keratinizing SCC of the cervix, she underwent a
    radical hysterectomy with salpingo-oophorectomy which demonstrated positive spread
    to the pelvic lymph nodes and the parametrium. Pathological examination revealed
    that the tumour also extensively involved the lower uterine segment.

## About the Model
An English Named Entity Recognition model, trained on Maccrobat to recognize the bio-medical entities (107 entities) from a given text corpus (case reports etc.). This model was built on top of distilbert-base-uncased

- Dataset: Maccrobat https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/MACCROBAT2018/9764942
- Carbon emission: 0.0279399890043426 Kg
- Training time: 30.16527 minutes
- GPU used : 1 x GeForce RTX 3060 Laptop GPU

Checkout the tutorial video for explanation of this model and corresponding python library: https://youtu.be/xpiDPdBpS18

## Usage
The easiest way is to load the inference api from huggingface and second method is through the pipeline object offered by transformers library.
```python
from transformers import pipeline
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForTokenClassification

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("d4data/biomedical-ner-all")
model = AutoModelForTokenClassification.from_pretrained("d4data/biomedical-ner-all")

pipe = pipeline("ner", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer, aggregation_strategy="simple") # pass device=0 if using gpu
pipe("""The patient reported no recurrence of palpitations at follow-up 6 months after the ablation.""")
```
