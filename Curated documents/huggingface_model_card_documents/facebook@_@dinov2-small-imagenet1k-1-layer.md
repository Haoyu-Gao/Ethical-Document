# Vision Transformer (small-sized model) trained using DINOv2

Vision Transformer (ViT) model trained using the DINOv2 method. It was introduced in the paper [DINOv2: Learning Robust Visual Features without Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07193) by Oquab et al. and first released in [this repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/dinov2). 

Disclaimer: The team releasing DINOv2 did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by the Hugging Face team.

## Model description

The Vision Transformer (ViT) is a transformer encoder model (BERT-like) pretrained on a large collection of images in a self-supervised fashion. 

Images are presented to the model as a sequence of fixed-size patches, which are linearly embedded. One also adds a [CLS] token to the beginning of a sequence to use it for classification tasks. One also adds absolute position embeddings before feeding the sequence to the layers of the Transformer encoder.

Note that this model does not include any fine-tuned heads. 

By pre-training the model, it learns an inner representation of images that can then be used to extract features useful for downstream tasks: if you have a dataset of labeled images for instance, you can train a standard classifier by placing a linear layer on top of the pre-trained encoder. One typically places a linear layer on top of the [CLS] token, as the last hidden state of this token can be seen as a representation of an entire image.

## Intended uses & limitations

You can use the model for classifying an image among one of the [1000 ImageNet labels](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/label-files/blob/main/imagenet-1k-id2label.json). See the [model hub](https://huggingface.co/models?search=facebook/dinov2) to look for
other fine-tuned versions on a task that interests you.

### How to use

Here is how to use this model:

```python
from transformers import AutoImageProcessor, AutoModelForImageClassification
from PIL import Image
import requests

url = 'http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg'
image = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)

processor = AutoImageProcessor.from_pretrained('facebook/dinov2-small-imagenet1k-1-layer')
model = AutoModelForImageClassification.from_pretrained('facebook/dinov2-small-imagenet1k-1-layer')

inputs = processor(images=image, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model(**inputs)
logits = outputs.logits
predicted_class_idx = logits.argmax(-1).item()
print("Predicted class:", model.config.id2label[predicted_class_idx])
```
