# 🎹 Speaker embedding

Relies on pyannote.audio 2.1: see [installation instructions](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio/).

This model is based on the [canonical x-vector TDNN-based architecture](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8461375), but with filter banks replaced with [trainable SincNet features](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8639585). See [`XVectorSincNet`](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio/blob/3c988c028dc505c64fe776720372f6fe816b585a/pyannote/audio/models/embedding/xvector.py#L104-L169) architecture for implementation details.


## Basic usage

```python
# 1. visit hf.co/pyannote/embedding and accept user conditions
# 2. visit hf.co/settings/tokens to create an access token
# 3. instantiate pretrained model
from pyannote.audio import Model
model = Model.from_pretrained("pyannote/embedding", 
                              use_auth_token="ACCESS_TOKEN_GOES_HERE")
```

```python
from pyannote.audio import Inference
inference = Inference(model, window="whole")
embedding1 = inference("speaker1.wav")
embedding2 = inference("speaker2.wav")
# `embeddingX` is (1 x D) numpy array extracted from the file as a whole.

from scipy.spatial.distance import cdist
distance = cdist(embedding1, embedding2, metric="cosine")[0,0]
# `distance` is a `float` describing how dissimilar speakers 1 and 2 are.
```

Using cosine distance directly, this model reaches 2.8% equal error rate (EER) on VoxCeleb 1 test set.   
This is without voice activity detection (VAD) nor probabilistic linear discriminant analysis (PLDA).
Expect even better results when adding one of those.

## Advanced usage

### Running on GPU

```python
import torch
inference.to(torch.device("cuda"))
embedding = inference("audio.wav")
```

### Extract embedding from an excerpt

```python
from pyannote.audio import Inference
from pyannote.core import Segment
inference = Inference(model, window="whole")
excerpt = Segment(13.37, 19.81)
embedding = inference.crop("audio.wav", excerpt)
# `embedding` is (1 x D) numpy array extracted from the file excerpt.
```

### Extract embeddings using a sliding window

```python
from pyannote.audio import Inference
inference = Inference(model, window="sliding",
                      duration=3.0, step=1.0)
embeddings = inference("audio.wav")
# `embeddings` is a (N x D) pyannote.core.SlidingWindowFeature
# `embeddings[i]` is the embedding of the ith position of the 
# sliding window, i.e. from [i * step, i * step + duration].
```
