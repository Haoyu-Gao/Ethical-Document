# Enformer

Enformer model. It was introduced in the paper [Effective gene expression prediction from sequence by integrating long-range interactions.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01252-x) by Avsec et al. and first released in [this repository](https://github.com/deepmind/deepmind-research/tree/master/enformer). 

This repo contains the official weights released by Deepmind, ported over to Pytorch.

## Model description

Enformer is a neural network architecture based on the Transformer that led to greatly increased accuracy in predicting gene expression from DNA sequence.

We refer to the [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01252-x) published in Nature for details.

### How to use

Refer to the README of [enformer-pytorch](https://github.com/lucidrains/enformer-pytorch) regarding usage.
