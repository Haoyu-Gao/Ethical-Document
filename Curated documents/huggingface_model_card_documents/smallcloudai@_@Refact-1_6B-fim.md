# Refact-1.6B

Finally, the model we started training with our [blog post](https://refact.ai/blog/2023/applying-recent-innovations-to-train-model/) is ready ðŸŽ‰

After fine-tuning on generated data, it beats Replit 3b, Stability Code 3b and many other models. It almost beats
StarCoder ten times the size!


Model                 | Size          | HumanEval pass@1   | HumanEval pass@10  |
----------------------|---------------|--------------------|--------------------|

Likely, it's the best model for practical use in your IDE for code completion because it's smart and fast!
You can start using it right now by downloading the
[Refact plugin](https://refact.ai/). You can host the model yourself, too, using the
[open source docker container](https://github.com/smallcloudai/refact).

And it's multi-language (see MultiPL-HumanEval and other metrics below) and it works as a chat (see the section below).

# It Works As a Chat

The primary application of this model is code completion (infill) in multiple programming languages.
But it works as a chat quite well.

HumanEval results using instruction following (chat) format, against models specialized for chat only:

Model                  | Size   | pass@1   | pass@10  |
-----------------------|--------|----------|----------|
<b>Refact-1.6-fim</b>  | 1.6b   |  38.4%   | 55.6%    |
StableCode-instruct    |   3b   |  26.9%   | 36.2%    |
OctoGeeX               |   6b   |  44.7%   |          |
CodeLlama-instruct     |   7b   |  34.8%   | 64.3%    |
CodeGen2.5-instruct    |   7b   |  36.2%   | 60.87    |
CodeLlama-instruct     |  13b   |  42.7%   | 71.6%    |
StarChat-Î²             |  15b   |  33.5%   |          |
OctoCoder              |  15b   |  46.2%   |          |


# Example

Fill-in-the-middle uses special tokens to identify the prefix/middle/suffix part of the input and output:

```python
# pip install -q transformers
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

checkpoint = "smallcloudai/Refact-1_6B-fim"
device = "cuda" # for GPU usage or "cpu" for CPU usage

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(checkpoint)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(checkpoint, trust_remote_code=True).to(device)

prompt = '<fim_prefix>def print_hello_world():\n    """<fim_suffix>\n    print("Hello world!")<fim_middle>'

inputs = tokenizer.encode(prompt, return_tensors="pt").to(device)
outputs = model.generate(inputs, max_length=100, temperature=0.2)
print("-"*80)
print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))
```

# Chat Format

The same model works as chat (experimental).

```python
prompt_template = "<empty_output>SYSTEM {system}\n" \
                  "<empty_output>USER {query}\n" \
                  "<empty_output>ASSISTANT"
prompt = prompt_template.format(system="You are a programming assistant",
                                query="How do I sort a list in Python?")
```

# Architecture

As described in more detail in the blog post, we used:

- [ALiBi](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12409) based attention
- [LayerNorm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06450v1) instead of [RMSNorm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.07467.pdf)
- [Multi Query Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02150)

We also used LiON, flash attention, early dropout. It's not that innovative that you can't run it, in fact you can -- see an example below.


# Pretraining

For the base model, we used our own dataset that contains code with permissive licenses only, and open text datasets.
Filtering is the key to success of this model:

- We only used text in English
- Only topics related to computer science
- Applied heavy deduplication

The text to code proportion was 50:50, model trained for 1.2T tokens. 

We don't release the base model, because its Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) capability likes to repeat itself too much, so
its practical use is limited. But if you still want it, write us a message on Discord.


# Finetuning

We tested our hypothesis that chat data should boost base model performance in FIM and
regular left-to-right code completion. We found that just 15% of open
[code](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigcode/commitpackft)
[instruction-following](https://huggingface.co/datasets/rombodawg/2XUNCENSORED_MegaCodeTraining188k) datasets,
that we filtered for quality, improves almost all metrics.

Additionally, to improve FIM, we observed common failure modes, and prepared a synthetic dataset based on
[The Stack dedup v1.1](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigcode/the-stack-dedup) to address them.

There is a distribution shift between typical code on the internet, and the code you write in your IDE.
The former is likely finished, so the model tries to come up with a suggestion that makes the code complete.
You are likely to have half-written code as you work on it, there is no single addition that can repair it
fully.

In practice, model needs to have a tendency to stop after a couple of lines are added, and sometimes don't write
anything at all. We found that just giving it empty completions, single line completions, multiline
completions that end with a smaller text indent or at least a newline -- makes it much more usable. This data
was used as the rest 85% of the finetune dataset.

The final model is the result of several attempts to make it work as good as possible for code completion,
and to perform well on a wide range of metrics. The best attempt took 40B tokens.


# Limitations and Bias

The Refact-1.6B model was trained on text in English. But it has seen a lot more languages in
code comments. Its performance on non-English languages is lower, for sure.
