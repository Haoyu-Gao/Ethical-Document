# Model Card for Mistral 7B SFT Î²

This model is a fine-tuned version of [mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1) on the HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k dataset. It is the SFT model that was used to train Zephyr-7B-Î² with Direct Preference Optimization.

It achieves the following results on the evaluation set:
- Loss: 0.9399

## Model description

- **Model type:** A 7B parameter GPT-like model fine-tuned on a mix of publicly available, synthetic datasets.
- **Language(s) (NLP):** Primarily English
- **License:** MIT
- **Finetuned from model:** [mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1)

### Model Sources

<!-- Provide the basic links for the model. -->

- **Repository:** https://github.com/huggingface/alignment-handbook

## Intended uses & limitations

The model was fine-tuned with [ðŸ¤— TRL's](https://github.com/huggingface/trl) `SFTTrainer` on a filtered and preprocessed of the [`UltraChat`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/stingning/ultrachat) dataset, which contains a diverse range of synthetic dialogues generated by ChatGPT. 

Here's how you can run the model using the `pipeline()` function from ðŸ¤— Transformers:

```python
# Install transformers from source - only needed for versions <= v4.34
# pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git
# pip install accelerate

import torch
from transformers import pipeline

pipe = pipeline("text-generation", model="HuggingFaceH4/mistral-7b-sft-beta", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, device_map="auto")

# We use the tokenizer's chat template to format each message - see https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/chat_templating
messages = [
    {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "You are a friendly chatbot who always responds in the style of a pirate",
    },
    {"role": "user", "content": "How many helicopters can a human eat in one sitting?"},
]
prompt = pipe.tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, tokenize=False, add_generation_prompt=True)
outputs = pipe(prompt, max_new_tokens=256, do_sample=True, temperature=0.7, top_k=50, top_p=0.95)
print(outputs[0]["generated_text"])
# <|system|>
# You are a friendly chatbot who always responds in the style of a pirate.</s>
# <|user|>
# How many helicopters can a human eat in one sitting?</s>
# <|assistant|>
# Ah, me hearty matey! But yer question be a puzzler! A human cannot eat a helicopter in one sitting, as helicopters are not edible. They be made of metal, plastic, and other materials, not food!
```
