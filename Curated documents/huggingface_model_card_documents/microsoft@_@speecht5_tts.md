# SpeechT5 (TTS task)

SpeechT5 model fine-tuned for speech synthesis (text-to-speech) on LibriTTS.

This model was introduced in [SpeechT5: Unified-Modal Encoder-Decoder Pre-Training for Spoken Language Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07205) by Junyi Ao, Rui Wang, Long Zhou, Chengyi Wang, Shuo Ren, Yu Wu, Shujie Liu, Tom Ko, Qing Li, Yu Zhang, Zhihua Wei, Yao Qian, Jinyu Li, Furu Wei.

SpeechT5 was first released in [this repository](https://github.com/microsoft/SpeechT5/), [original weights](https://huggingface.co/mechanicalsea/speecht5-tts). The license used is [MIT](https://github.com/microsoft/SpeechT5/blob/main/LICENSE).



## Model Description

Motivated by the success of T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer) in pre-trained natural language processing models, we propose a unified-modal SpeechT5 framework that explores the encoder-decoder pre-training for self-supervised speech/text representation learning. The SpeechT5 framework consists of a shared encoder-decoder network and six modal-specific (speech/text) pre/post-nets. After preprocessing the input speech/text through the pre-nets, the shared encoder-decoder network models the sequence-to-sequence transformation, and then the post-nets generate the output in the speech/text modality based on the output of the decoder.

Leveraging large-scale unlabeled speech and text data, we pre-train SpeechT5 to learn a unified-modal representation, hoping to improve the modeling capability for both speech and text. To align the textual and speech information into this unified semantic space, we propose a cross-modal vector quantization approach that randomly mixes up speech/text states with latent units as the interface between encoder and decoder.

Extensive evaluations show the superiority of the proposed SpeechT5 framework on a wide variety of spoken language processing tasks, including automatic speech recognition, speech synthesis, speech translation, voice conversion, speech enhancement, and speaker identification.

# Uses

<!-- Address questions around how the model is intended to be used, including the foreseeable users of the model and those affected by the model. -->

## ðŸ¤— Transformers Usage

You can run SpeechT5 TTS locally with the ðŸ¤— Transformers library.

1. First install the ðŸ¤— [Transformers library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers), sentencepiece, soundfile and datasets(optional):

```
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade transformers sentencepiece datasets[audio]
```

2. Run inference via the `Text-to-Speech` (TTS) pipeline. You can access the SpeechT5 model via the TTS pipeline in just a few lines of code!

```python
from transformers import pipeline
from datasets import load_dataset
import soundfile as sf

synthesiser = pipeline("text-to-speech", "microsoft/speecht5_tts")

embeddings_dataset = load_dataset("Matthijs/cmu-arctic-xvectors", split="validation")
speaker_embedding = torch.tensor(embeddings_dataset[7306]["xvector"]).unsqueeze(0)
# You can replace this embedding with your own as well.

speech = synthesiser("Hello, my dog is cooler than you!", forward_params={"speaker_embeddings": speaker_embedding})

sf.write("speech.wav", speech["audio"], samplerate=speech["sampling_rate"])
```

3. Run inference via the Transformers modelling code - You can use the processor + generate code to convert text into a mono 16 kHz speech waveform for more fine-grained control.

```python
from transformers import SpeechT5Processor, SpeechT5ForTextToSpeech, SpeechT5HifiGan
from datasets import load_dataset
import torch
import soundfile as sf
from datasets import load_dataset

processor = SpeechT5Processor.from_pretrained("microsoft/speecht5_tts")
model = SpeechT5ForTextToSpeech.from_pretrained("microsoft/speecht5_tts")
vocoder = SpeechT5HifiGan.from_pretrained("microsoft/speecht5_hifigan")

inputs = processor(text="Hello, my dog is cute.", return_tensors="pt")

# load xvector containing speaker's voice characteristics from a dataset
embeddings_dataset = load_dataset("Matthijs/cmu-arctic-xvectors", split="validation")
speaker_embeddings = torch.tensor(embeddings_dataset[7306]["xvector"]).unsqueeze(0)

speech = model.generate_speech(inputs["input_ids"], speaker_embeddings, vocoder=vocoder)

sf.write("speech.wav", speech.numpy(), samplerate=16000)
```
