# ðŸŽ¹ Speaker diarization

Relies on pyannote.audio 2.1.1: see [installation instructions](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio#installation).

## TL;DR

```python
# 1. visit hf.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization and accept user conditions
# 2. visit hf.co/pyannote/segmentation and accept user conditions
# 3. visit hf.co/settings/tokens to create an access token
# 4. instantiate pretrained speaker diarization pipeline
from pyannote.audio import Pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline.from_pretrained("pyannote/speaker-diarization@2.1",
                                    use_auth_token="ACCESS_TOKEN_GOES_HERE")


# apply the pipeline to an audio file
diarization = pipeline("audio.wav")

# dump the diarization output to disk using RTTM format
with open("audio.rttm", "w") as rttm:
    diarization.write_rttm(rttm)
```

## Advanced usage

In case the number of speakers is known in advance, one can use the `num_speakers` option:

```python
diarization = pipeline("audio.wav", num_speakers=2)
```

One can also provide lower and/or upper bounds on the number of speakers using `min_speakers` and `max_speakers` options:

```python
diarization = pipeline("audio.wav", min_speakers=2, max_speakers=5)
```

## Benchmark 

### Real-time factor

Real-time factor is around 2.5% using one Nvidia Tesla V100 SXM2 GPU (for the neural inference part) and one Intel Cascade Lake 6248 CPU (for the clustering part).

In other words, it takes approximately 1.5 minutes to process a one hour conversation.

### Accuracy

This pipeline is benchmarked on a growing collection of datasets.  

Processing is fully automatic:

* no manual voice activity detection (as is sometimes the case in the literature)
* no manual number of speakers (though it is possible to provide it to the pipeline)
* no fine-tuning of the internal models nor tuning of the pipeline hyper-parameters to each dataset

... with the least forgiving diarization error rate (DER) setup (named *"Full"* in [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csl.2021.101254)):

* no forgiveness collar
* evaluation of overlapped speech

## Technical report

This [report](technical_report_2.1.pdf) describes the main principles behind version `2.1` of pyannote.audio speaker diarization pipeline.  
It also provides recipes explaining how to adapt the pipeline to your own set of annotated data. In particular, those are applied to the above benchmark and consistently leads to significant performance improvement over the above out-of-the-box performance.
