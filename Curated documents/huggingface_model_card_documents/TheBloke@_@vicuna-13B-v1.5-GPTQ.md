## Provided files and GPTQ parameters

Multiple quantisation parameters are provided, to allow you to choose the best one for your hardware and requirements.

Each separate quant is in a different branch.  See below for instructions on fetching from different branches.

All recent GPTQ files are made with AutoGPTQ, and all files in non-main branches are made with AutoGPTQ. Files in the `main` branch which were uploaded before August 2023 were made with GPTQ-for-LLaMa.

<details>
  <summary>Explanation of GPTQ parameters</summary>

- Bits: The bit size of the quantised model.
- GS: GPTQ group size. Higher numbers use less VRAM, but have lower quantisation accuracy. "None" is the lowest possible value.
- Act Order: True or False. Also known as `desc_act`. True results in better quantisation accuracy. Some GPTQ clients have had issues with models that use Act Order plus Group Size, but this is generally resolved now.
- Damp %: A GPTQ parameter that affects how samples are processed for quantisation. 0.01 is default, but 0.1 results in slightly better accuracy.
- GPTQ dataset: The dataset used for quantisation. Using a dataset more appropriate to the model's training can improve quantisation accuracy. Note that the GPTQ dataset is not the same as the dataset used to train the model - please refer to the original model repo for details of the training dataset(s).
- Sequence Length: The length of the dataset sequences used for quantisation. Ideally this is the same as the model sequence length. For some very long sequence models (16+K), a lower sequence length may have to be used.  Note that a lower sequence length does not limit the sequence length of the quantised model. It only impacts the quantisation accuracy on longer inference sequences.
- ExLlama Compatibility: Whether this file can be loaded with ExLlama, which currently only supports Llama models in 4-bit.

## How to download from branches

- In text-generation-webui, you can add `:branch` to the end of the download name, eg `TheBloke/vicuna-13B-v1.5-GPTQ:main`
- With Git, you can clone a branch with:
```
git clone --single-branch --branch main https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/vicuna-13B-v1.5-GPTQ
```
- In Python Transformers code, the branch is the `revision` parameter; see below.

## How to easily download and use this model in [text-generation-webui](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui).

Please make sure you're using the latest version of [text-generation-webui](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui).

It is strongly recommended to use the text-generation-webui one-click-installers unless you're sure you know how to make a manual install.

1. Click the **Model tab**.
2. Under **Download custom model or LoRA**, enter `TheBloke/vicuna-13B-v1.5-GPTQ`.
  - To download from a specific branch, enter for example `TheBloke/vicuna-13B-v1.5-GPTQ:main`
  - see Provided Files above for the list of branches for each option.
3. Click **Download**.
4. The model will start downloading. Once it's finished it will say "Done".
5. In the top left, click the refresh icon next to **Model**.
6. In the **Model** dropdown, choose the model you just downloaded: `vicuna-13B-v1.5-GPTQ`
7. The model will automatically load, and is now ready for use!
8. If you want any custom settings, set them and then click **Save settings for this model** followed by **Reload the Model** in the top right.
  * Note that you do not need to and should not set manual GPTQ parameters any more. These are set automatically from the file `quantize_config.json`.
9. Once you're ready, click the **Text Generation tab** and enter a prompt to get started!

## How to use this GPTQ model from Python code

### Install the necessary packages

Requires: Transformers 4.32.0 or later, Optimum 1.12.0 or later, and AutoGPTQ 0.4.2 or later.

```shell
pip3 install transformers>=4.32.0 optimum>=1.12.0
pip3 install auto-gptq --extra-index-url https://huggingface.github.io/autogptq-index/whl/cu118/  # Use cu117 if on CUDA 11.7
```

If you have problems installing AutoGPTQ using the pre-built wheels, install it from source instead:

```shell
pip3 uninstall -y auto-gptq
git clone https://github.com/PanQiWei/AutoGPTQ
cd AutoGPTQ
pip3 install .
```

### For CodeLlama models only: you must use Transformers 4.33.0 or later.

If 4.33.0 is not yet released when you read this, you will need to install Transformers from source:
```shell
pip3 uninstall -y transformers
pip3 install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git
```

### You can then use the following code

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, pipeline

model_name_or_path = "TheBloke/vicuna-13B-v1.5-GPTQ"
# To use a different branch, change revision
# For example: revision="main"
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name_or_path,
                                             device_map="auto",
                                             trust_remote_code=False,
                                             revision="main")

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name_or_path, use_fast=True)

prompt = "Tell me about AI"
prompt_template=f'''A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: {prompt} ASSISTANT:

'''

print("\n\n*** Generate:")

input_ids = tokenizer(prompt_template, return_tensors='pt').input_ids.cuda()
output = model.generate(inputs=input_ids, temperature=0.7, do_sample=True, top_p=0.95, top_k=40, max_new_tokens=512)
print(tokenizer.decode(output[0]))

# Inference can also be done using transformers' pipeline

print("*** Pipeline:")
pipe = pipeline(
    "text-generation",
    model=model,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    max_new_tokens=512,
    do_sample=True,
    temperature=0.7,
    top_p=0.95,
    top_k=40,
    repetition_penalty=1.1
)

print(pipe(prompt_template)[0]['generated_text'])
```
