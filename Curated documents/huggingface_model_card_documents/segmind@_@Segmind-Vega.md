# Segmind-Vega Model Card


## Demo

Try out the Segmind-Vega model at [Segmind-Vega](https://www.segmind.com/models/segmind-vega) for âš¡ fastest inference.

## Model Description

The Segmind-Vega Model is a distilled version of the Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL), offering a remarkable **70% reduction in size** and an impressive **100% speedup** while retaining high-quality text-to-image generation capabilities. Trained on diverse datasets, including Grit and Midjourney scrape data, it excels at creating a wide range of visual content based on textual prompts.

Employing a knowledge distillation strategy, Segmind-Vega leverages the teachings of several expert models, including SDXL, ZavyChromaXL, and JuggernautXL, to combine their strengths and produce compelling visual outputs.

## Usage:
This model can be used via the ðŸ§¨ Diffusers library. 

Make sure to install diffusers by running
```bash
pip install diffusers
```

In addition, please install `transformers`, `safetensors`, and `accelerate`:
```bash
pip install transformers accelerate safetensors
```

To use the model, you can run the following:

```python
from diffusers import StableDiffusionXLPipeline
import torch

pipe = StableDiffusionXLPipeline.from_pretrained("segmind/Segmind-Vega", torch_dtype=torch.float16, use_safetensors=True, variant="fp16")
pipe.to("cuda")
# if using torch < 2.0
# pipe.enable_xformers_memory_efficient_attention()
prompt = "A cute cat eating a slice of pizza, stunning color scheme, masterpiece, illustration" # Your prompt here
neg_prompt = "(worst quality, low quality, illustration, 3d, 2d, painting, cartoons, sketch)" # Negative prompt here
image = pipe(prompt=prompt, negative_prompt=neg_prompt).images[0]
```

### Please do use negative prompting and a CFG around 9.0 for the best quality!

### Out-of-Scope Use

The Segmind-Vega Model is not suitable for creating factual or accurate representations of people, events, or real-world information. It is not intended for tasks requiring high precision and accuracy.

## Limitations and Bias

**Limitations & Bias:**
The Segmind-Vega Model faces challenges in achieving absolute photorealism, especially in human depictions. While it may encounter difficulties in incorporating clear text and maintaining the fidelity of complex compositions due to its autoencoding approach, these challenges present opportunities for future enhancements. Importantly, the model's exposure to a diverse dataset, though not a cure-all for ingrained societal and digital biases, represents a foundational step toward more equitable technology. Users are encouraged to interact with this pioneering tool with an understanding of its current limitations, fostering an environment of conscious engagement and anticipation for its continued evolution.
