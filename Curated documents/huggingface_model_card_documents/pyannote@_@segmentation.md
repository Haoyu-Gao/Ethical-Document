extra_gated_prompt: The collected information will help acquire a better knowledge
  of pyannote.audio userbase and help its maintainers apply for grants to improve
  it further. If you are an academic researcher, please cite the relevant papers in
  your own publications using the model. If you work for a company, please consider
  contributing back to pyannote.audio development (e.g. through unrestricted gifts).
  We also provide scientific consulting services around speaker diarization and machine
  listening.

# 🎹 Speaker segmentation

[Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04045) | [Demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/pyannote/pretrained-pipelines) | [Blog post](https://herve.niderb.fr/fastpages/2022/10/23/One-speaker-segmentation-model-to-rule-them-all)

![Example](example.png)

## Usage

Relies on pyannote.audio 2.1.1: see [installation instructions](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio).

```python
# 1. visit hf.co/pyannote/segmentation and accept user conditions
# 2. visit hf.co/settings/tokens to create an access token
# 3. instantiate pretrained model
from pyannote.audio import Model
model = Model.from_pretrained("pyannote/segmentation", 
                              use_auth_token="ACCESS_TOKEN_GOES_HERE")
```

### Voice activity detection

```python
from pyannote.audio.pipelines import VoiceActivityDetection
pipeline = VoiceActivityDetection(segmentation=model)
HYPER_PARAMETERS = {
  # onset/offset activation thresholds
  "onset": 0.5, "offset": 0.5,
  # remove speech regions shorter than that many seconds.
  "min_duration_on": 0.0,
  # fill non-speech regions shorter than that many seconds.
  "min_duration_off": 0.0
}
pipeline.instantiate(HYPER_PARAMETERS)
vad = pipeline("audio.wav")
# `vad` is a pyannote.core.Annotation instance containing speech regions
```

### Overlapped speech detection

```python
from pyannote.audio.pipelines import OverlappedSpeechDetection
pipeline = OverlappedSpeechDetection(segmentation=model)
pipeline.instantiate(HYPER_PARAMETERS)
osd = pipeline("audio.wav")
# `osd` is a pyannote.core.Annotation instance containing overlapped speech regions
```

### Resegmentation

```python
from pyannote.audio.pipelines import Resegmentation
pipeline = Resegmentation(segmentation=model, 
                          diarization="baseline")
pipeline.instantiate(HYPER_PARAMETERS)
resegmented_baseline = pipeline({"audio": "audio.wav", "baseline": baseline})
# where `baseline` should be provided as a pyannote.core.Annotation instance
```

### Raw scores

```python
from pyannote.audio import Inference
inference = Inference(model)
segmentation = inference("audio.wav")
# `segmentation` is a pyannote.core.SlidingWindowFeature
# instance containing raw segmentation scores like the 
# one pictured above (output)
```

## Reproducible research 

In order to reproduce the results of the paper ["End-to-end speaker segmentation for overlap-aware resegmentation
"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04045), use `pyannote/segmentation@Interspeech2021` with the following hyper-parameters:
