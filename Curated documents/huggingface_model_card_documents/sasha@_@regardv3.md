# BERT Regard classification model 

This model is the result of a project entitled [Towards Controllable Biases in Language Generation](https://github.com/ewsheng/controllable-nlg-biases). It consists of a BERT classifier (no ensemble) trained on 1.7K samples of biased language. 

*Regard*  measures language polarity towards and social perceptions of a demographic (compared to sentiment, which only measures overall language polarity).
