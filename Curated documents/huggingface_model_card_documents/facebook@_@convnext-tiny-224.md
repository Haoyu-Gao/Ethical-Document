# ConvNeXT (tiny-sized model) 

ConvNeXT model trained on ImageNet-1k at resolution 224x224. It was introduced in the paper [A ConvNet for the 2020s](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03545) by Liu et al. and first released in [this repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ConvNeXt). 

Disclaimer: The team releasing ConvNeXT did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by the Hugging Face team.

## Model description

ConvNeXT is a pure convolutional model (ConvNet), inspired by the design of Vision Transformers, that claims to outperform them. The authors started from a ResNet and "modernized" its design by taking the Swin Transformer as inspiration.

## Intended uses & limitations

You can use the raw model for image classification. See the [model hub](https://huggingface.co/models?search=convnext) to look for
fine-tuned versions on a task that interests you.

### How to use

Here is how to use this model to classify an image of the COCO 2017 dataset into one of the 1,000 ImageNet classes:

```python
from transformers import ConvNextImageProcessor, ConvNextForImageClassification
import torch
from datasets import load_dataset

dataset = load_dataset("huggingface/cats-image")
image = dataset["test"]["image"][0]

processor = ConvNextImageProcessor.from_pretrained("facebook/convnext-tiny-224")
model = ConvNextForImageClassification.from_pretrained("facebook/convnext-tiny-224")

inputs = processor(image, return_tensors="pt")

with torch.no_grad():
    logits = model(**inputs).logits

# model predicts one of the 1000 ImageNet classes
predicted_label = logits.argmax(-1).item()
print(model.config.id2label[predicted_label]),
```
