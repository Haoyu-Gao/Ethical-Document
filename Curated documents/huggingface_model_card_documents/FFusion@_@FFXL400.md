# FFXL400 Combined LoRA Model üöÄ

Welcome to the FFXL400 combined LoRA model repository on Hugging Face! This model is a culmination of extensive research, bringing together the finest LoRAs from the [400GB-LoraXL repository](https://huggingface.co/FFusion/400GB-LoraXL). Our vision was to harness the power of multiple LoRAs, meticulously analyzing and integrating a select fraction of the blocks from each. 

## üì¶ Model Highlights

- **Innovative Combination**: This model is a strategic integration of LoRAs, maximizing the potential of each while creating a unified powerhouse.
- **Versatility**: The model is available in various formats including diffusers, safetensors (both fp 16 and 32), and an optimized ONNIX FP16 version for DirectML, ensuring compatibility across AMD, Intel, Nvidia, and more.
- **Advanced Research**: Leveraging the latest in machine learning research, the model represents a state-of-the-art amalgamation of LoRAs, optimized for performance and accuracy.

## üîç Technical Insights

This model is a testament to the advancements in the field of AI and machine learning. It was crafted with precision, ensuring that:

- Only a small percentage of the blocks from the original LoRAs (UNet and text encoders) were utilized.
- The model is primed not just for inference but also for further training and refinement.
- It serves as a benchmark for testing and understanding the cumulative impact of multiple LoRAs when used in concert.

## üé® Usage 

The FFXL400 model is designed for a multitude of applications. Whether you're delving into research, embarking on a new project, or simply experimenting, this model serves as a robust foundation. Use it to:

- Investigate the cumulative effects of merging multiple LoRAs.
- Dive deep into weighting experiments with multiple LoRAs.
- Explore the nuances and intricacies of integrated LoRAs.

## üìö Background

The FFXL400 is built upon the insights and data from the [400GB-LoraXL repository](https://huggingface.co/FFusion/400GB-LoraXL). Each LoRA in that collection was extracted using the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) technique, providing a rich dataset for research and exploration. The FFXL400 is the pinnacle of that research, representing a harmonious blend of the best LoRAs.

### HowMuch ???
![60% Works](https://img.shields.io/badge/60%25%20of%20the%20Time-It%20Works%20Every%20Time-green)


**Have you ever asked yourself, "How much space have I wasted on `*.ckpt` and `*.safetensors` checkpoints?"** ü§î
Say hello to HowMuch: Checking checkpoint wasted space since... well, now! 

üòÑ Enjoy this somewhat unnecessary, yet **"fun-for-the-whole-family"** DiskSpaceAnalyzer tool. üòÑ

## Overview


`HowMuch` is a Python tool designed to scan your drives (or a specified directory) and report on the total space used by files with specific extensions, mainly `.ckpt` and `.safetensors`. 

It outputs:
- The total storage capacity of each scanned drive or directory.
- The space occupied by `.ckpt` and `.safetensors` files.
- The free space available.
- A neat bar chart visualizing the above data.

## Installation
[GitHub](https://github.com/1e-2/HowMuch)

### From PyPI

You can easily install `HowMuch` via pip:

```bash
pip install howmuch
```

### From Source

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/1e-2/HowMuch.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory and install:

   ```bash
   cd HowMuch
   pip install .
   ```

## Usage


Run the tool without any arguments to scan all drives:

```bash
howmuch
```

Or, specify a particular directory or drive to scan:

```bash
howmuch --scan C:
```
