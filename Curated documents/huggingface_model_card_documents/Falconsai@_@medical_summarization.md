- text: 'the need for magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) in patients with an implanted
    pacemaker or implantable cardioverter - defibrillator ( icd ) is a growing clinical
    issue . it is estimated that as many as 75% of active cardiac device recipients
    will become indicated for mri . currently , the vast majority of such devices
    are contraindicated for use with an mri . in european heart rhythm association
    survey , published recently for non - mri - certified icds ( 0.51.5 t field strength
    ) , the totally subcutaneous icd ( s - icd ) system , an implantable defibrillator
    with no leads that touch the heart , has recently been demonstrated to be a safe
    and effective defibrillator option for patients at risk for sudden cardiac death
    . it provides shock therapy and post - shock pacing therapy , but no long - term
    bradycardia pacing . although it has been shown as an alternative to the standard
    transvenous icd , its compatibility with mri remains unclear . various types of
    clinical mri systems currently use a superconductive magnet that creates a static
    magnetic field strength , typically 1.5 or 3 t. the use of mri with most pacemakers
    and icds is considered a contraindication due to potential hazards , including
    heating of the electrode that resides in or on the heart , damage to myocardium
    , elevation of pacing thresholds , unintended induction of ventricular tachycardia
    ( vt ) or ventricular fibrillation ( vf ) , pacing inhibition , permanent device
    malfunction , and distortion of the mri scan . recently , mr - conditional. mr
    - conditional indicates a lack of known hazards in a specified mri environment
    with specified conditions of use . due to the variety of mri scanners and scanning
    protocols , it is not practical to test even a single device under all conditions
    . hence , mr - conditional labelling dictates that the device is safe for use
    under certain scanning conditions , as well as how the cardiac device should be
    programmed before an exposure to the magnetic field in a mri scanner . the literature
    , although limited , provides some guidance for imaging patients with implanted
    pacemakers or icds that do not have mr - conditional labelling . this single -
    centre prospective non - controlled study describes the first use of mri in patients
    with an implanted s - icd . patients with implanted s - icd systems ( boston scientific
    sqrx model 1010 and q - trak model 3010 ) were enrolled for mri testing over a
    period of 18 months . the s - icd system implanted in this patient cohort was
    composed of a can implanted in a left mid - lateral pocket and a para - sternal
    subcutaneous electrode . the s - icd is currently not certified for use with an
    mri ; therefore , the ethics committee of homolka hospital , prague , czech republic
    approved our clinical study . patients with newly implanted s - icd systems (
    < 6 weeks ) were excluded , and none of the patients had any intravascular leads
    . the patients were randomized for either a cardiac , brain , cervical , or lumbar
    spinal scan . one of the subjects underwent an additional knee examination , due
    to reported chronic pain . a total of 15 patients were enrolled into this study
    ( 12 males and three females , aged 2283 years , mean 53 years . subjects in our
    cohort ( table 1 ) underwent a total of 22 mri scans between 6 june 2012 and 24
    december 2013 . in total , five brain scans , three cardiac scans , 12 lumbar
    scans , one knee , and one cervical spine scan were conducted ( table 2 ) . however
    , in one patient a minor disc protrusion was found , in other mri revealed stenosis
    of intervertebral foramen which was causing radicular pain of the nerve root l4
    and based on this examination the patient was referred to ct - navigated periradicular
    therapy . table 1summary of patient anatomical data and scan locations , along

    , heating near or around the electrode can not harm the myocardium . however ,
    heating near the electrode or can with the s - icd system may still cause serious
    patient discomfort . therefore , along with education of subjects , each patient
    was instrumented by taping an oesophageal temperature probe ( beta - therm model

    system was programmed to therapy each s - icd system was evaluated prior to and
    immediately after the scan to verify proper functioning , including interrogation
    , sensing , and battery voltage . after the completion of the mri , the s - icd
    system was reprogrammed to original settings . long - term regular clinical follow
    - up and checking of the device were performed . no anomalies were noted via pulse
    oximetry or ecg during the scans for any of the patients . eleven of 15 patients
    reported no sensation or pain from heating of the can , two of 15 patients reported
    feeling some heating , and two patients reported intolerable heating ( see table
    2 ) . in patients with intolerable heating , the scan was halted within seconds
    and changed to a scan of the brain , which proceeded without incident . patient
    reports of heating in the vicinity of the can occurred only during lumbar scans
    with a thermistor probe ; no such reports occurred during scans of the brain ,
    cardiac area , cervical spine , or without the probe . in two cases where heating
    in the vicinity of the can was reported by the patient , the scan sequence was
    altered to reduce the intensity of radiofrequency ( rf ) field exposure by reducing
    the turbo factor ( e.g. from 21 to 7 ) , increasing the repetition time ( e.g.
    to > 4000 ms ) , and reducing the flip angle ( e.g. from 170 to 120 ) . the target
    values were chosen arbitrarily to maintain image contrast ( flip angle ) and keep
    scan time at reasonable limits ( turbo factor and repetition time ) . less heating
    was noted by patients after these modifications to the scan parameters were made
    . 03 ) was observed to have a skin lesion , appearing to be a circular rash or
    ulcer on the surface of the skin over the can , approximately 35 mm in diameter
    . the cause of this skin anomaly is not known ; it was later noted to have fully
    healed at a follow - up 10 days after the scan . to ascertain the effect of heating
    due to the instrumented thermistor catheter , the two patients who experienced
    the heating ( examinations 9 and 16 , see table 2 ) were rescanned several weeks
    later without the thermistor catheter in place ( examinations 11 and 17 ) . first
    , modified sequence ( with even lower amount of energy deposited in the tissue
    ) was used , which caused no heating . as no sensation was reported by the subjects
    , they were asked to report even a minimal discomfort , and the lumbar scans were
    performed using the same settings that resulted in heating with the thermistor
    catheter in place in the first imaging session . the results of the rescans revealed
    that no heating was felt by the patients when the thermistor catheter was absent
    . there were no noted changes to battery voltage , ability to detect the qrs signal
    or stored diagnostic data . pacing thresholds can not be assessed by the s - icd
    system , so this was not evaluated . none of the patients reported any pulling
    or twisting of the can or pain from heating of the s - icd electrode . for scans
    of the brain , lumbar spine , knee , and cervical spine , no effect from image
    artefact was noted in the anatomical area of interest . however , for scans of
    the cardiac area , image artefact was noted to interfere with the ability to see
    parts of the left ventricle , though the right ventricle of the heart was unaffected
    and could be imaged usefully . this was due to the can and not the electrode (
    see figure 1 ) , modifications to the protocol for the lumbar spine resulted in
    a lower signal - to - noise ratio ; however , the images remain in diagnostic

    in the same subject ( lower image , there are several reports in the current literature
    about mr - conditional pacemakers from several companies , but very limited reports
    about mr - conditional icds . biotronik announced in late 2011 release of their
    first mr - compatible icd device and defibrillator leads pro mri , but in the
    conditions of use excluded scanning of the torso and focused more on the extremities
    examination . in european heart rhythm association survey , 60% of centres did
    not implant any mri - certified icds , 34.3% implanted < 10 icd devices , and
    only 5.6% implanted 10 and more icds ; one - fifth of responders stated that mri
    - certified icds should be implanted in all patients but lack of reimbursement
    was indicated as a possible obstacle to implant more mri - certified pacemakers
    / icds by 47.1% of responding centres . none of the components of the s - icd
    system are on or in the heart . the s - icd depends less upon being in direct
    contact with the myocardium to function and instead uses far - field sensing and
    stimulation to provide the shock and post - shock pacing therapy . as a consequence
    , unlike transvenous systems heating near or around the electrode can not harm
    the myocardium , which could present with possible safety consequences such as
    an elevation in pacing thresholds or scarring of the myocardium , but it may still
    cause serious patient discomfort . because the s - icd is larger than modern transvenous
    icd ''s , there may be more potential for the can to experience heating due to
    the magnetic gradient or rf field . we report results from what we believe is
    the first experience of mri scanning in patients with an implanted s - icd and
    in various anatomical areas . overall , mri was performed safely in all patients
    , which is in contrast to the current literature with mri imaging in patients
    with electrical - active devices which are not mri - conditional . in our study
    , the primary clinically significant event attributable to the mri scan was the
    occurrence of heating in the area of the pocket in the four patients that underwent
    lumbar scans . it was not known if this was due to the s - icd can itself or an
    artefact of the thermistor catheter used to measure skin temperature over the
    pocket . this required a revision of our protocol , which was to re - scan two
    of the patients who complained of heating . re - scanning of these patients without
    the thermistor probe resulted in no complaints of heating , so it is assumed that
    the thermistor catheter itself heated during the lumbar scans and caused the discomfort
    . as further evidence , all the heating complaints occurred during rf - intensive
    scan sequences ( namely fast spin echo ) with the temperature probe located axially
    near the centre of the bore , where rf fields are the highest . the thermistor
    catheter is constructed of insulated conductive cables connected to electrodes
    and should couple to the rf fields efficiently , causing heating at the electrodes
    and pain or damage on the surface of the skin where the probe was placed over
    the s - icd can . if the heating was due to the s - icd can itself , it would
    more likely occur during gradient - intensive scan sequences ( which can generate
    eddy currents on can surfaces and internal components ) and at locations in the
    bore where there are high gradient fields , such as near the bore edges . however
    , when the patient was scanned with gradient - intensive scan sequences ( e.g.
    flair dwi ) and with the s - icd system in high gradient field locations in the
    bore ( e.g. such as during a brain scan ) , patients did not detect any heating
    or discomfort . in addition , the subcutaneous lead , which was not instrumented
    with a thermistor catheter , never resulted in any heating sensation noted by
    the patient , even when exactly the same sequence that resulted in heating in
    the first session was used . the use of mri - compatible temperature monitors
    such as fibre optic temperature probes would have provided better confirmation
    of possible skin temperature elevation and would not have been affected by the
    rf fields . for cardiac imaging , the main problem to solve is metallic artefact
    , especially on the gradient - echo sequences . like in research performed by
    nazarian et al . , several scan protocols were used to see if any yielded different
    effects or reduced the qualitative extent of artefact . gradient mode was changed
    from normal to whisper , resulting in slower ramping of the field and therefore
    diminishing the changes of the magnetic field in time . artefacts when present
    were limited to blurring of the left ventricle during cardiac scans and most yielded
    clinically useful information . standard interrogation of the s - icd revealed
    no adverse effects upon the functioning of the system . while no adverse effects
    upon the post - scan s - icd device function were noted , not all possible scanning
    protocols were tested . it should be noted that , four of the s - icd ''s were
    exposed to repeat mri scans without adverse effects to device function . in addition
    , because the s - icd does not provide long - term bradycardia pacing , it is
    assumed that pacemaker - dependent patients would not be implanted with this system
    . the inhibition of the pacemaker function during the scanning sequence and possible
    pacing threshold changes are a unique concern in patients implanted with transvenous
    icds . this study included only 15 patients and 22 scans done on the same 1.5
    t mri scanner . thus , even these preliminary results should only be applied to
    1.5 t mri scanners ( similarly as reported in the present literature for other
    implantable devices ) . device functionality was tested immediately after the
    scan but not for long - term effects . in addition , not all device functions
    were tested although the s - icd system does have a beeper / interrogation warning
    if battery levels or memory irregularities occur . however , patients were scheduled
    for regular check - up and no defect of the device was observed in following 725
    months ( mean observation time 18 months ) . delayed enhancement mri for determining
    cardiac scarring was also not tested . also , there are other anatomical areas
    that were not evaluated , such as shoulder and knees . this study included only
    15 patients and 22 scans done on the same 1.5 t mri scanner . thus , even these
    preliminary results should only be applied to 1.5 t mri scanners ( similarly as
    reported in the present literature for other implantable devices ) . device functionality

    . also , there are other anatomical areas that were not evaluated , such as shoulder
    and knees . while more data are required to support a claim of mri - conditional
    , this study is the study to demonstrate the feasibility of exposing s - icd patients
    to mri using the scanning and monitor protocol described , with some precautionary
    measures including : ( i ) programming the device therapy off ; ( ii ) limiting
    the sar to 2.0 w / kg ; ( iii ) continuous monitoring of the patients pulse oximetry
    and ecg by qualified personnel and especially for any feelings of heating ; (
    iv ) evaluate device function post scan ; ( v ) availability of full resuscitation
    facilities at the mri site . given the variables of different mri scanners , the
    decision to perform mri on patients with an implanted s - icd system should be
    balanced against the potential risks . in our study , the only heating was very
    likely introduced by not fully mri - compatible thermometer probe ; subjects rescanned
    without the probe did not report any abnormalities during the scan of any body
    area listed ( brain , cervical and lumbar spine , heart , and knee ) . this study

To use this model for medical text summarization, you can follow these steps:


```python
from transformers import pipeline

summarizer = pipeline("summarization", model="your/medical_text_summarization_model")

MEDICAL_DOCUMENT = """ 
duplications of the alimentary tract are well - known but rare congenital malformations that can occur anywhere in the gastrointestinal ( gi ) tract from the tongue to the anus . while midgut duplications are the most common , foregut duplications such as oesophagus , stomach , and parts 1 and 2 of the duodenum account for approximately one - third of cases . 
 they are most commonly seen either in the thorax or abdomen or in both as congenital thoracoabdominal duplications . 
 cystic oesophageal duplication ( ced ) , the most common presentation , is often found in the lower third part ( 60 - 95% ) and on the right side [ 2 , 3 ] . hydatid cyst ( hc ) is still an important health problem throughout the world , particularly in latin america , africa , and mediterranean areas . 
 turkey , located in the mediterranean area , shares this problem , with an estimated incidence of 20/100 000 . 
 most commonly reported effected organ is liver , but in children the lungs are the second most frequent site of involvement [ 4 , 5 ] . in both ced and hc , the presentation depends on the site and the size of the cyst . 
 hydatid cysts are far more common than other cystic intrathoracic lesions , especially in endemic areas , so it is a challenge to differentiate ced from hc in these countries . here , 
 we present a 7-year - old girl with intrathoracic cystic mass lesion , who had been treated for hydatid cyst for 9 months , but who turned out to have oesophageal cystic duplication . 
 a 7-year - old girl was referred to our clinic with coincidentally established cystic intrathoracic lesion during the investigation of aetiology of anaemia . 
 the child was first admitted with loss of vision in another hospital ten months previously . 
 the patient 's complaints had been attributed to pseudotumour cerebri due to severe iron deficiency anaemia ( haemoglobin : 3 g / dl ) . 
 chest radiography and computed tomography ( ct ) images resulted in a diagnosis of cystic intrathoracic lesion ( fig . 
 the cystic mass was accepted as a type 1 hydatid cyst according to world health organization ( who ) classification . 
 after 9 months of medication , no regression was detected in ct images , so the patient was referred to our department . 
 an ondirect haemagglutination test result was again negative . during surgery , after left thoracotomy incision , a semi - mobile cystic lesion , which was almost seven centimetres in diameter , with smooth contour , was found above the diaphragm , below the lung , outside the pleura ( fig . 
 the entire fluid in the cyst was aspirated ; it was brown and bloody ( fig . 
 2 ) . the diagnosis of cystic oesophageal duplication was considered , and so an attachment point was searched for . 
 it was below the hiatus , on the lower third left side of the oesophagus , and it also was excised completely through the hiatus . 
 pathologic analysis of the specimen showed oesophageal mucosa with an underlying proper smooth muscle layer . 
 computed tomography image of the cystic intrathoracic lesion cystic lesion with brownish fluid in the cyst 
 compressible organs facilitate the growth of the cyst , and this has been proposed as a reason for the apparent prevalence of lung involvement in children . diagnosis is often incidental and can be made with serological tests and imaging [ 5 , 7 ] . 
 laboratory investigations include the casoni and weinberg skin tests , indirect haemagglutination test , elisa , and the presence of eosinophilia , but can be falsely negative because children may have a poor serological response to eg . 
 false - positive reactions are related to the antigenic commonality among cestodes and conversely seronegativity can not exclude hydatidosis . 
 false - negative results are observed when cysts are calcified , even if fertile [ 4 , 8 ] . in our patient iha levels were negative twice . 
 due to the relatively non - specific clinical signs , diagnosis can only be made confidently using appropriate imaging . 
 plain radiographs , ultrasonography ( us ) , or ct scans are sufficient for diagnosis , but magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) is also very useful [ 5 , 9 ] . 
 computed tomography demonstrates cyst wall calcification , infection , peritoneal seeding , bone involvement fluid density of intact cysts , and the characteristic internal structure of both uncomplicated and ruptured cysts [ 5 , 9 ] . 
 the conventional treatment of hydatid cysts in all organs is surgical . in children , small hydatid cysts of the lungs 
 respond favourably to medical treatment with oral administration of certain antihelminthic drugs such as albendazole in certain selected patients . 
 the response to therapy differs according to age , cyst size , cyst structure ( presence of daughter cysts inside the mother cysts and thickness of the pericystic capsule allowing penetration of the drugs ) , and localization of the cyst . in children , small cysts with thin pericystic capsule localised in the brain and lungs respond favourably [ 6 , 11 ] . 
 respiratory symptoms are seen predominantly in cases before two years of age . in our patient , who has vision loss , the asymptomatic duplication cyst was found incidentally . 
 the lesion occupied the left hemithorax although the most common localisation reported in the literature is the lower and right oesophagus . 
 the presentation depends on the site and the size of the malformations , varying from dysphagia and respiratory distress to a lump and perforation or bleeding into the intestine , but cysts are mostly diagnosed incidentally . 
 if a cystic mass is suspected in the chest , the best technique for evaluation is ct . 
 magnetic resonance imaging can be used to detail the intimate nature of the cyst with the spinal canal . 
 duplications should have all three typical signs : first of all , they should be attached to at least one point of the alimentary tract ; second and third are that they should have a well - developed smooth muscle coat , and the epithelial lining of duplication should represent some portions of alimentary tract , respectively [ 2 , 10 , 12 ] . in summary , the cystic appearance of both can cause a misdiagnosis very easily due to the rarity of cystic oesophageal duplications as well as the higher incidence of hydatid cyst , especially in endemic areas .
