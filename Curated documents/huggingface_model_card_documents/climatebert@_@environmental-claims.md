# Model Card for environmental-claims

## Model Description

The environmental-claims model is fine-tuned on the [EnvironmentalClaims](https://huggingface.co/datasets/climatebert/environmental_claims) dataset by using the [climatebert/distilroberta-base-climate-f](https://huggingface.co/climatebert/distilroberta-base-climate-f) model as pre-trained language model. The underlying methodology can be found in our [research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00507).

## How to Get Started With the Model

You can use the model with a pipeline for text classification:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification, AutoTokenizer, pipeline
from transformers.pipelines.pt_utils import KeyDataset
import datasets
from tqdm.auto import tqdm

dataset_name = "climatebert/environmental_claims"
model_name = "climatebert/environmental-claims"

# If you want to use your own data, simply load them as ðŸ¤— Datasets dataset, see https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/loading
dataset = datasets.load_dataset(dataset_name, split="test")

model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name, max_len=512)

pipe = pipeline("text-classification", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer, device=0)

# See https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.pipeline
for out in tqdm(pipe(KeyDataset(dataset, "text"), padding=True, truncation=True)):
   print(out)
```
