## Tokenizer

During training the text was preprocessed using the original English BERT base tokenizer. We suggest the same tokenizer is used for inference.

## Model output

The model classifies each input into one of four distinct classes:
* 0 - acceptable
* 1 - inappropriate
* 2 - offensive
* 3 - violent
