# Model Description

This repo contains ONNX exports for the CLIP model [openai/clip-vit-base-patch32](https://huggingface.co/openai/clip-vit-base-patch32). 
It separates the visual and textual encoders into separate models for the purpose of generating image and text embeddings.

This repo is specifically intended for use with [Immich](https://immich.app/), a self-hosted photo library.
