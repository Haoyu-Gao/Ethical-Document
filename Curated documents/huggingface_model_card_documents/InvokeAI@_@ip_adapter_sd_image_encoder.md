This is the Image Encoder required for SD1.5 IP Adapter model to function correctly. It is compatible with version 3.2+ of Invoke AI.

IP Adapter allows for users to input an Image Prompt, which is interpreted by the system, and passed in as conditioning for the image generation process.

The Community Edition of Invoke AI can be found at invoke.ai or on GitHub at https://github.com/invoke-ai/InvokeAI
